A standalone sequel to Bhool Bhulaiyaa ,  the film stars Tabu, Kartik Aaryan, and Kiara Advani. The plot follows Ruhaan Randhawa, who has to pretend to be a fraud psychic to deal with the return of Manjulika, a malevolent spirit hell-bent on vengeance against the Thakur family. The film is loosely based on the Malayalam film Geethaanjali directed by Priyadarshan, which was based on the Agatha Christie's novel Elephants Can Remember.\n Production Principal photography began in October 2019 and filming was completed in February 2022. Primarily filmed in real mansions in Jaipur and Lucknow, other shooting locations included Mumbai and Manali. The film's score was composed by Sandeep Shirodkar while the songs were composed by Pritam and Tanishk Bagchi, with lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, Sameer, Yo Yo Honey Singh, Mandy Gill and Saaveri Verma. It features a remix single of the 2007 film's title track by Neeraj Shridhar.\n Development Initially set for release on 31 July 2020, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 was delayed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was theatrically released worldwide on 20 May 2022 and received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Tabu and Aaryan's performances, humour, musical score, cinematography and direction but received criticism for the writing, editing and soundtrack. The film earned \u20b9266.88 crore  worldwide to become the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022.\n Filming Across a mansion in Bhawanigarh, Rajasthan in 2004, the priests confine a malevolent spirit named Manjulika, who is hell-bent on attacking the family's daughter-in-law Anjulika to a room. After this, the family deserts the mansion for safety.\n Release 18 years later, in Himachal Pradesh, Ruhaan Randhawa meets Reet Thakur who is on a trip to Bhawanigarh via Chandigarh to marry her fianc\u00e9e Sagar reluctantly. They board a bus to Chandigarh but cut short their journey for attending a music carnival and later discover that the bus they were supposed to travel met with an accident, killing everyone on board. Subsequently, the Thakurs, who are owners of the mansion that was deserted 18 years ago, assumed her to be dead. Reet tries contacting her family but over the phone she overhears a conversation between Trisha and Sagar, realizing an affair brewing between them. Seeking to earn them the gift of marriage so she could avoid falling into it, Reet plays along her family's presumption about her demise and travels to Bhawanigarh with a hesitating Ruhaan.\n Theatrical They decide to hide in the deserted ancestral mansion, but Chote Pandit, a priest, spots the doors of the mansion opened and informs the Thakurs, who along with the villagers enter the mansion and spot Ruhaan, who covers up the situation by lying that Reet's spirit led him there and her final wish is to see her family living in the ancestral mansion and that too with Trisha being married. Under Ruhaan's influence, The Thakurs fix Trisha's wedding with Sagar. Due to his presumed ability of communicating with spirits, Ruhaan becomes popular as Rooh Baba, where he and Reet become friends. When Ruhaan is led to the room where the spirit was trapped, Anjulika, Reet's sister-in-law, warns him to stay away from the room and reveals that the spirit is actually Anjulika's twin sister Manjulika. \n Home media The sisters had migrated to the mansion when their father Debanshu was asked to manage accounts for the Thakurs. Debanshu's biased affection towards Anjulika's talents instilled jealousy in Manjulika which turned into hatred. In 2004, both the sisters fell in love with Uday Thakur, Reet's elder brother. However, Uday reciprocated Anjulika's feelings leaving Manjulika fuming and deceived. Manjulika, who sought solace in learning black magic, decided to use the magic as a weapon against Anjulika. On the night of Uday and Anjulika's wedding, Manjulika brutally stabbed Debanshu for finding out the truth and set out to murder Anjulika, but she saved herself and stabbed Manjulika in self-defense killing her. Despite being dead, Manjulika did not leave the family alone as her spirit continued to harm them and paralyzed Uday by pushing him off the balcony. The priests captured Manjulika and lock her in the third floor.\n Soundtrack After the flashback, Reet's father reveals to Ruhaan that Manjulika's curse had killed eight members of their family. One night, Chote Pandit finds Ruhaan and Reet roaming around the mansion and discovers the truth. With the help of his elder brother Bade Pandit and his wife whose business is being affected due to Ruhaan's popularity, Chote Pandit spearheads a search in the mansion. Knowing that no one would enter Manjulika's room, Reet resolves to hide there and Chote Pandit's accusations are proved false to the family. Freed, Manjulika attacks Anjulika, who discovers the truth about Reet being alive and joins hands with Ruhaan and Reet to ward off the spirit. They take help from the same priest who captured Manjulika's spirit but he tells them that he requires three days. Manjulika's spirit possesses the priest and makes him kill his disciples before being killed by himself. Ruhaan encounters the spirit and falls off the terrace out of fear.\n Reception Ruhaan returns to the palace, conversing in Bengali, and claims himself to be Manjulika revealing that he is possessed. The Thakurs spot Reet and learn that she is alive. Ruhaan attacks Anjulika, who uses Reet as a human shield by threatening to slit her throat if Ruhaan attacks her and addresses him as \"Anjulika\", which confuses the family. Ruhaan reveals that he has been putting up an act of being possessed by the spirit and that the woman who died in 2004 was actually Anjulika while one who is living with them is the real Manjulika.\n Critical response In 2004, after killing Debanshu with the help of the priest, revealed to be Manjulika's accomplice, Manjulika influenced Anjulika using black magic and stole her identity. Disguised as Manjulika under the influence of black magic, Anjulika attacked Manjulika who stabbed her to death under the pretext of self-defense. When Uday discovered the truth, Manjulika pushed him off the balcony, paralyzing him and thus preventing him from telling anyone. She also killed eight members of the family for learning the truth. Presently, Anjulika's spirit attacks Manjulika and imprisons her in the same room in which she got locked in 2004. Anjulika's spirit has a moment with her family and asks Reet's father to forgive her since it revealed the truth of Anjulika and Manjulika. She thanks Ruhaan and asks the family to leave as she has unfinished business with Manjulika. Anjulika enters the room and kills the real Manjulika. The whole Thakur family leaves the palace, which becomes abandoned again.\n Box office A sequel to Bhool Bhulaiyaa  was officially announced on 19 August 2019. Bhushan Kumar, chairman of T-Series, had long considered creating a franchise based on the 2007 film. Aakash Kaushik and Farhad Samji had two separate scripts prepared for their independent films. Samji felt that elements of their two scripts could work together for a new film, and they pitched the idea to producer Murad Khetani. Khetani felt the idea had promise and could work as a sequel to Bhool Bhulaiyaa. Eventually, he approached Kumar, who came on board, collaborating with Khetani for the second time since Kabir Singh, which also starred Kiara Advani.\n Sequel Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 began filming on 9 October 2019 and wrapped up on 25 February 2022. Aaryan lost his voice while filming the climax sequence of the film. It was filmed in a real mansion. Filming was occurring in Lucknow, before the pandemic disrupted schedule. It was shot in Mumbai and Manali.\n References Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 was released on 20 May 2022. The film was originally scheduled to be released in theaters on July 31, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n External links"

He lives in Bhopal with his widowed mother Shobha, an aspiring chef who hopes to make it big on social media through her cookery channels, and his best friend, Chaddi, who is preparing for the civil services examination. Uday wants to pursue his post-graduation in orthopaedics, inspired by his distant cousin Dr. Ashok Gupta. His rank in the competitive entrance test, however, is insufficient for an orthopaedics course in Bhopal. Unwilling to leave his mother behind and move to another city for his studies, Uday reluctantly opts for the best available option in Bhopal\u2014gynaecology. Ashok also advises Uday to take this opportunity; Uday can simultaneously continue to study for next year's entrance test. Uday is introduced to Kavya Sharma, a high school student who also aspires to become a doctor and whom Ashok is infatuated with.\n Development Uday's initiation into Gynaecology starts on a bad note\u2014he is instantly ticked off by the head of the department, the strict Dr. Nandini Srivastav, for joining the course 10 days late, and he gets bullied by his colleagues, all of whom are female. Uday blames his ex-girlfriend Ruchi for his present state and, egged on by Ashok, drunkenly calls her and vents his frustrations. His lack of interest at work and his mistakes irritate Nandini, who asks Uday why he doesn't want to become a gynaecologist. Uday replies that male gynaecologists tend not to do well because patients prefer a female doctor examining them. Nandini rubbishes this and asks him to lose his \"male touch\". Following this, Uday gradually befriends his colleagues, especially his senior, Dr. Fatima Siddiqui. Eventually, he falls for her and the two share a passionate kiss, although Fatima dismisses the act as nothing serious, reminding a disappointed Uday that while he is a good friend, she is set to marry the man she loves, Aarif. She also invites him to their engagement.\n Filming On a day the hospital is understaffed, Uday tries to examine a female patient without a female attendant, an act considered unethical. A fight breaks out and the patient and her husband later formally complain against him. While facing a disciplinary enquiry, Uday performs his first delivery in the hospital, a case of precipitate labour. The grateful family, who had lost two pregnancies before, name the baby after him. Uday finally understands his duty as a doctor towards his patients. At the enquiry, testimonies of Uday's colleagues clear his name.

Meanwhile, Ashok has got Kavya pregnant and needs to get an abortion. A prominent doctor and married with two children, Ashok cannot go with Kavya to a hospital himself, so he asks Uday to take her. Check-ups reveal that Kavya has placenta praevia, making abortion difficult. Nandini refuses when Uday requests her to perform the operation herself, stating that it might threaten Kavya's life and thus her family should be informed first. Ashok asks Uday to keep Kavya at his home for the time being, and the two bond well. Kavya tells him that she had first doubted Ashok's character the day he had encouraged Uday to call and rant against Ruchi; Uday feels ashamed of his past behaviour.\n Release On the day of the engagement, Ashok calls Uday and tells him to take Kavya to his clinic, because he has \"come up with a solution\". Arriving home, Uday is shocked to find Shobha partying with an elderly stranger, who turns out to be her Tinder date. Infuriated, Uday orders both the old man and Chaddi\u2014who had helped Shobha get on Tinder in the first place\u2014out of the house. When Uday claims that he has made sacrifices for her sake, Shobha snaps back, relating the difficulties she had raising him as a single mother. Now that her son has grown up, she now desires companionship. Mother and son then make peace.\n Reception Soon, Uday receives a call from Kavya\u2014she is in intense pain after receiving an injection at a private clinic. He and Shobha rescue her and rush her to the hospital, where Nandini performs an emergency operation and saves her life. Ashok arrives at the hospital and confronts Uday, but he hits back. Since Kavya is a minor and below the age of consent, the matter is turned over to the police, who arrest Ashok for statutory rape. Uday again has to face an enquiry, and possible rustication, for lying to Nandini about Kavya's age earlier. Nandini, however, sees that Uday is now a changed man, and decides against punishing him.

Years later, Bilal Ahmed, the blasts' mastermind seeks refuge with dreaded terrorist Omar Hafeez at POK, as they begin planning more such attacks. Omar's son Riyaaz has formed a sleeper cell network consisting of 40 terrorists who pose as Indians, aiming to conduct more bombings after the 26/11 attacks. Surya is now the DCP and ATS chief plans an operation in Jaisalmer, where he and his team kidnap Riyaaz who was hiding his identity.\n Filming Joint CP and Surya's senior officer Kabir Shroff, who was the only person able to fully solve the case, reveals that about a full ton of RDX was brought to India, of which 400 kgs were used during the 1993 bombings and the remnant 600 kgs are still buried somewhere in the country. Surya plans to catch the sleeper cell's remaining members. He also tries to reconcile with his estranged wife Dr. Ria Gupta, with whom he parted ways due to a misunderstanding, but to no avail. Surya comes across Islamic priest Kader Usmani, in fact a terrorist and Bilal's aide. Usmani meets Bilal, whose residence in Sawantwadi houses the wanted 600 kgs of RDX. They remove the buried RDX and prepare for the next bombings. Bilal reaches Mumbai with the help of taxi driver John Mascarenhas who left for Bangkok.\n Casting Surya catches Bilal, who confesses that he undertook the bombings as an act of vengeance for his family being killed in communal riots and shoots himself to death. Later, John is apprehended in Bangkok post a long chase between him and Surya, who learns that the bombs were being made by another member of the sleeper cell. Usmani and John are arrested; Surya plans to pretend to torture Usmani's daughters to make him confess. Usmani finally reveals that Riyaaz will meet him at his aide Rafique's residence. A suicidal bomb planted there kills Usmani, whose elder daughter helps in identifying the bombmaker Mukhtar Ansari, who is hiding in Shivgarh. Surya sends Inspector Sangram \"Simmba\" Bhalerao to arrest him.\n Music Simmba tells Surya that 7 bombs are to be planted at 7 locations in Mumbai. Riyaaz escapes, and it is revealed that the ATS's headquarters would also be bombed. Surya and his team enlist NSG's help to safely extradite the bombs via helicopters and the bombings get botched. However, Riyaaz and his team use Ria as a suicide bomber to attack the ATS headquarters keeping Surya, Simmba and the other cops as hostages. Surya's friend DCP Bajirao Singham arrives and they defuse the bomb wrapped around Ria while killing all the terrorists. They capture Mukhtar, Riyaaz and his younger brother Raza who taunt Singham, Simmba, and Surya that they have been in India as sleeper cells for many years, carrying several attacks in Mumbai, and that the police cannot harm them. An enraged Singham, Simmba, and Surya shoot them to death, thus bringing peace in Mumbai.\n Release \n Theatrical Sooryavanshi was announced in December 2018 through post-credit scenes of Simmba.

Later that night, a drunk Om gives an emotional speech to Pappu as he dreams of becoming a great actor. Om and Pappu take small acting roles in films which are filmed at R.C. Studios, a major filming compound owned by Mukesh Mehra, a charming but egotistical person who is a wealthy and famous film producer.\n Production While shooting one day, Shanti gets trapped in a fire that grows out of control during filming. Risking his life, Om jumps into the fire and rescues her. Shanti is grateful towards him, and the two become friends. Om lies to Shanti that he is a popular Tamil film actor to impress her. He even puts an act of the filming of his feature, but ultimately tells Shanti the truth of him being a small-time extra upon seeing her genuine fondness for him.\n Development Shanti forgives Om and they spend a happy evening with each other, and she gifts him a snow globe. However, things take a turn when Om accidentally ends up overhearing a heated conversation between Shanti and Mukesh. He is shocked to discover that they have been married for two years but have not revealed it in public as that will ruin both of their careers. Shanti reveals to Mukesh that she is also pregnant with his child, leaving Om heartbroken. He avoids Shanti entirely.\n Casting The next night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of her upcoming film titled Om Shanti Om and tells her that they will cancel its production and instead have a grand marriage ceremony. Om goes to the set to meet Shanti for the last time and return her snow globe but is dejected upon seeing her with Mukesh. He leaves and throws the snow globe in a fountain pond nearby. \n Principal photography Meanwhile, Mukesh tells Shanti that his marriage with Shanti and the unborn child will destroy his successful career. In order to prevent that, he sets fire to the set and locks a horrified Shanti in it, in order to kill her and the unborn child. As he exits the set, Om spots Shanti in the flames and attempts to go and rescue her but is attacked by Mukesh's guards, leaving him severely injured. After they leave, he manages to enter the set but is thrown out of the building by a big explosion. Om staggers on the road as the set burns down with Shanti in it.\n Music Om is left devastated upon witnessing this and suddenly gets hit by the car of renowned actor Rajesh Kapoor. He takes him to a hospital with his pregnant wife Lovely Kapoor who is under labor. The serious injuries of Om result in his death while still reminiscing about Shanti.  Rajesh's assistant Nasser asks his surgeon to keep this a secret from Bela and Pappu. Moments later, Rajesh and Lovely are blessed with a baby boy, and they name him Om Kapoor.\n Release 30 years later, Om Kapoor is shown as a rich young man who is a superstar in Hindi films and is revealed to be the rebirth of Om Prakash Makhija. He experiences Pyrophobia and often comes across Bela who believes him to be her son and tries to take him to her house. An aged Pappu tries to make her understand that he is someone else but she pays no heed to him. Om also ignores her and leaves upon thinking that she has gone crazy. \n Theatrical He and his assistant Anwar Sheikh subsequently drive to the abandoned R.C. Studios for the filming of one of Om's films. Om recognizes the place and experiences some flashbacks of his previous life. He even finds Shanti's broken snow globe and is confused. That night, Om remembers the emotional speech he had given to Pappu in a drunken state when he wins the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. As he gives the same speech to the audience, Pappu watches his award function on TV and realizes that his friend is reborn as Om Kapoor. Meanwhile, a grand party is thrown for Om's success. Om remembers his whole previous life upon being visited by Mukesh, who now works in Hollywood and wishes to make a film with him.\n Screening and statics Later that night, he traces Bela and Pappu to the crawl and has an emotional reunion with them. The three plan to avenge Shanti's death by making Mukesh confess his crime.\n Pre-sale records The next day, Om manages to convince Mukesh to resume the filming of Om Shanti Om at the same ruined R.C. Studios. He auditions several actresses to find Shanti's look-alike but in vain. However, Om ends up coming across Sandhya aka Sandy, a ditzy but lovely girl who is an exact doppelganger of Shanti. He hires her without revealing his plan and ends up firing her as she is unable to act properly. On Pappu's advice, Om reveals his plan to Sandy who promises him that she will help him according to his plan. \n Home media At the inaugural ceremony of the Om Shanti Om set, Bela scares Mukesh in the disguise of an old witch, and Om and Pappu try to light Shanti's photograph on fire to remind him of his crime. Although the setup doesn't work, the photograph is supernaturally lit by fire which disturbs Mukesh and confuses Om and Pappu. Mukesh is more horrified when Sandy appears in front of him dressed as Shanti in a make-up room. Eventually, he decides to leave for US after seeing Shanti in the footage of Om Shanti Om but Om asks him to wait for some days. He eventually performs the story of Shanti's life through a song in front of Mukesh during the music launch of Om Shanti Om. However, Mukesh discovers Sandy's real identity as her body bleeds due to an injury. Mukesh attempts to chase her but is knocked unconscious by a falling chandelier. \n Legal issue After he regains consciousness, Om confronts him over his crime but Mukesh taunts him that he or his \"duplicate Shanti\" cannot convict him for the murder as there is no proof for it. Just then, Sandy reaches the scene. She reveals that after the fire in the set died down, Mukesh returned to the place. Shanti was still alive then, but he buried her alive under the chandelier. She concludes that Shanti's corpse will be found under the chandelier, which will be proof of her murder for the court. Mukesh denies her revelation and attempts to shoot her but Om attacks him and a fire breaks out on the set. He shoots him in his leg and is about to murder him but Sandy stops him, saying that Mukesh is destined to die but not in his hands. She looks at the chandelier which falls and strikes Mukesh dead. \n Plagiarism allegations The next moment, Om is shocked when Pappu and Anwar reach the scene along with \"Sandy\". As he glances back at the one in front of him, he realizes that the one who had revealed the proof of Shanti's murder and killed Mukesh was the real Shanti, a.k.a. the ghost of Shanti. She was responsible for lighting the photograph with fire and knocking Mukesh unconscious too, helping him in his plan. Om reunites with Sandy and waves at Shanti who tearfully smiles at him and disappears, having finally attained peace.\n Reception The film ends with all its cast and crew approaching the set of Om Shanti Om and the credits roll.\n Box office \n Critical response In 2002, Farah Khan worked as a choreographer for the musical Bombay Dreams in London, which she felt presented a \"clich\u00e9d and outdated version\" of the Indian film industry. She thought that the musical would not be successful if released in India. She instead thought of a new story, writing her initial thoughts about the subject on Andrew Lloyd Webber's letterhead while staying in his house. Later in 2006, Farah began to work on her next project, which was tentatively titled Happy New Year. Amid speculations that Shah Rukh Khan would star in Happy New Year, the actor rejected the first draft of the film, upon which Farah's husband and editor Shirish Kunder reminded her of the story she had conceived while in London. Happy New Year, which was to mark Deepika Padukone's Hindi debut, was put on hiatus and revived more than 8 years later under the same title.\n India Farah completed writing the first script of Om Shanti Om within two weeks. She set the first half in the 1970s as she felt the Hindi films made during that period were much more influential than those made in other periods, particularly the 1980s, which she felt was a period when \"the worst movies were made\". She also included many references to the 1970s, which were also prevalent in films of that time. She said, \"Everything in the first half is about the 70s\u2014such as the mother who overacts, mouthing clich\u00e9d dialogues. Then there are cabarets, badminton and other stuff popular during that era.\" Shah Rukh's costumes were designed by Karan Johar, while Manish Malhotra designed Padukone's costumes. The rest of the cast had their costumes designed by Sanjeev Mulchandani.\n International In addition to directing the film, Farah co-wrote the story with Mayur Puri and Mushtaq Shiekh. She was also the film's choreographer. Puri wrote the screenplay and dialogues. He completed the writing process in two months and rewrote the film's second half. Puri created the screenplay by writing his natural reaction to the characters as scenarios. He knew that despite being part of a crowd, junior artists do not want to be recognised as such, ruins their chances of landing a leading role in future. This was used in a sequence involving Shah Rukh and Talpade, who play junior artists. Puri blended different genres together in Om Shanti Om, which he felt was challenging. He used his personal memories from childhood for creating the 1970s. Shirish Kunder was the editor, while V. Manikandan was the cinematographer.\n Accolades Sabu Cyril was the film's production designer. Sabu was first offered the Mani Ratnam-directed Guru  at a time when Om Shanti Om was being planned, but ultimately chosen the latter due to his earlier commitment to Farah for her future project. Farah used two particular dialogues in the film: \"When you want something badly, the whole universe conspires to give to you\" and \"In the end everything will be ok and if its not ok its not the end\". These were used as Khan felt that it reflected her philosophy in her life. Farah stated that the film's opening scene was her most favourite in it. In 2008, Puri felt his most favourite dialogue from the ones he wrote would be the Filmfare Awards speech. The film's title derives from the eponymous song from the film  Karz . Om is a Hindu mantra; Om Shanti Om roughly translates to \"Peace Be With You\".\n Impact The film opens with the grandeur shot of the most famous songs of Karz that is Om Shanti Om featuring Rishi Kapoor and SRK as a junior film artist standing in the crowd.\n Further reading Shah Rukh was cast as the lead; he gained six packs for a song sequence. He felt Om Shanti Om was a \"happy film\".\n Footnotes Farah was advised by Malaika Arora to cast Padukone as the female lead, who was suggested by Wendell Rodricks, under whom Padukone was working. She was cast without a screen test. Khan felt that she was \"a beautiful, classic Indian beauty\" who fit the role of an actor of the 1970s. She was excited at the prospect of working with Shah Rukh and said, \"I've grown up watching  and always admired him so much. To get to work with him\u00a0... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him.\"\n References In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language. Her character was modelled after Malini and nicknamed Dreamy Girl after her the latter's nickname as Dream Girl. Rampal was approached by both Khan and Shah Rukh at the latter's New Year's Eve party. Rampal was initially reluctant to do the role as he felt it was \"too evil\" for someone like him. With persuasion from Shah Rukh, he agreed. Rampal wore a mustache in the film which was suggested by Shah Rukh. Shreyas Talpade played a supporting role as the best friend of Khan's character. After the release of Iqbal  and completing the filming of Dor, Talpade, who attended the same gym as Khan, was called for a narration of what would be Om Shanti Om. He agreed to do the role.\n External links"

After the 2011 blockbuster Singham, Shetty had begun writing the script of the film but left it half-finished.

Upon reading the script, Khan liked the idea and agreed to star in it before the Angoor remake, causing Angoor's remake to be postponed.

The cops, headed by ex-CBI officer and DCP Aditya Rathore, deduce that the attack was orchestrated by Gautam Mehra, who is the son of businessman Divesh Mehra, and arrest him.\n Casting Flashback: Gautam is a spoilt brat, who is berated by Divesh for having created a commotion at his ex-girlfriend Siya's wedding. The commotion video has been made into a rap song by singer Aarvi. Gautam is ousted from the business and his house. Pretending to be in love with her, he helps her scare away her rival Q/Kiran. Aarvi falls for Gautam and reveals that her biological father Balkrishnan Shastri, a popular singer, had an extramarital affair with her mother, but never accepted either of them. Her main goal is to make her father accept her as his daughter by becoming a famous singer and then reject him. Gautam leaks Aarvi's childhood photos, implying that he was out to get even with her for humiliating him, and Shastri publicly rejects his daughter. Aarvi is heartbroken. Three months after the breakup, when Gautam gets attacked by Siya's husband Aditya, and Aarvi takes care of him, he realizes his love for her. He pleads with her to give him a second chance, but Aarvi leaves him, albeit with a heavy heart. \n Filming Present: Gautam escapes from the cops. Ganesan surmises that Gautam hasn't killed Aarvi. The cops interrogate Bhairav Purohit, whom Aarvi had called from her phone, the day she was murdered, but he denies committing the crime and there is no evidence either. Ganesan determines a pattern, that the killer only targets young girls with one-sided lovers, after discovering that 18 girls have been murdered with a similar modus operandi in the past 6 months. The ensuing circumstances motivate Ganesan to conclude that Gautam is not the serial killer, and it is later revealed that the serial killer is, in fact, Bhairav; Gautam fights him but is unable to see his face, which allows Bhairav to escape.  \n Soundtrack Flashback: Bhairav is a cab driver who works part-time as a zookeeper along with his widower friend Keshav, who has a son Yash, but ignores him for random girls he brings to the zoo.

The police also investigate the crime scene, where a girl's dead body is found inside the freezer, though it is not Aarvi. \n Box office Outside the station, Gautam sees Bhairav and Rasika hugging. Later that evening, both return to the zoo and attend to Aarvi's cage; Aarvi regains consciousness and stabs Bhairav with a glass shard that she found there. Rasika bursts into laughter while Bhairav attacks Aarvi. Gautam arrives to save her, and a fight ensues between the guys. Bhairav hits Gautam, who falls to the ground, and demands Rasika's reaction, but at this point, Gautam begins laughing and asks who and where \"Rasika\" is: in a shocking twist, it turns out that Bhairav was hallucinating her all along. Bhairav then reminisces that Rasika told him how Atul was planning to ditch his family for her; he had, in fact, inadvertently killed Rasika by cracking her back while begging her not to leave him. The body the cops found in the freezer is revealed to be Rasika's, which Bhairav kept for himself. He drops to the ground in dismay while Gautam and Aarvi reconcile.

It is a way to attribute.\"\n Notes In an interview with The Indian Express, Khan discussed about the possible epilogue of the movie; the couple had three children and moved to a small town for some time. Sejal then works as a lawyer while Harry takes time off and writes a book.

    "plot": "\n Plot Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India  is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language epic sports drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.\n Cast Produced on a budget of \u20b925 crore , Lagaan was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan's foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of the sports drama Naya Daur  in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar.\n Production Lagaan was theatrically released in India on 15 June 2001, clashing with Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. It received critical acclaim for Gowariker's direction, Khan's performance and the film's anti-imperialist stance. With earnings of \u20b965.97 crore  during its initial release, the film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001. Lagaan was screened at numerous international film festivals and garnered multiple accolades. It was the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India  and Salaam Bombay! . Lagaan became the most-awarded film at the 47th Filmfare Awards with eight wins, including Best Film, Best Director for Gowariker and Best Actor for Khan. At the 49th National Film Awards, the film won eight awards, including Best Popular Film.\n Development The farmers of Champaner village in the Central India Agency depend on monsoon rains for their livelihood. A delayed start to the monsoon has them worried and they head to the ruling British cantonment, to ask the King of Champaner, Puran Singh for an exemption from the year's tax . \n Casting A cricket match is underway between British officers. A young farmer named Bhuvan, provokes them by calling cricket a \"childish game\". Following the match, the local Raja  rejects the farmers' plea, but Andrew Russell, the captain of the British regiment, steps in. He offers a wager in exchange for the farmers playing against his team in a match of cricket. Should they win, he would cancel their tax for the next two years. Bhuvan is made to decide for the village, and agrees when Andrew raises the stakes. \n Pre-production The village elders are nervous at the prospect of losing the game and being required to pay triple the usual tax. Bhuvan refuses to apologise to Andrew or retract his decision, so the match must be played. Andrew's sister, Elizabeth, takes pity on the farmers. She offers to teach them the game in the interest of fairness. Bhuvan starts gathering a team of players for the match. \n Filming An unruly competitor, named Lakha, is part of Bhuvan's team. He has a grudge with him for their common interest in Gauri, daughter of the village medic. He informs Andrew of his sister's actions. Andrew forbids Elizabeth from leaving the cantonment. He is unaware that she has grown attached to the farmers and is also developing romantic feelings for Bhuvan. She continues sneaking out with the aid of local staff, and even attends a village festival. Gauri, who is secretly in love with Bhuvan, starts to grow envious of her.\n Music The match-day dawns and the ground fills with spectators from neighbouring villages. The British team bat first . The farmers must score one run more than the British before the match ends in three days. Smith and Burton begin well, with Smith getting a reprieve due to a Deva no-ball. However, the farmers fight back with Bhura running Smith out and Goli bowling out Burton. Andrew and Brooks bat well and end the day at 182/2. The farmers find out about Lakha's betrayal and he is almost killed, before Bhuvan saves him. Lakha takes a diving catch to dismiss Brooks on the second day.  Their inexperience shows, however, as their batsmen start getting dismissed early on while playing rashly. Bhuvan steadies the innings and takes the match into the third day. On the final morning, the farmers must achieve the score with weak batsmen remaining. Bhuvan plays sensibly, and the match enters the last over. Kachra, the striking player, scores one run off the last ball, but it is not enough to win. The British field umpire signals a no-ball , causing it to be replayed. Bhuvan scores six runs off the next ball and wins the match for the farmers. \n Release Elizabeth rushes to the grounds to find Bhuvan. She is heartbroken when she sees him tightly embracing Gauri, and returns to the cantonment. In the next few weeks, the British Empire orders disbandment of the regiment for the humiliation caused by losing to commoners. The tax collection is cancelled for three years, and Andrew is relocated to Central Africa for his improper management of the Treasury's funds. As her caravan departs, Elizabeth steps out to meet the villagers for the last time. Bhuvan remains unaware of her feelings for him, but thanks her for her help. She bids the villagers farewell and returns to England, choosing to remain unmarried, while Bhuvan marries Gauri in a grand ceremony in the village.\n Home media Lagaan was inspired by Naya Daur , a sports drama film directed by B. R. Chopra, written by Akhtar Mirza and Kamil Rashid, and starring Dilip Kumar, Vyjayanthimala and Ajit Khan.\n Reception Director Gowariker has stated that it was almost impossible to make Lagaan. He went to Khan, who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script. Khan had initially rejected the idea of a \"sporty\" film, but was \"himself in tears\" upon hearing the full dialogued script. Even after securing Khan, Gowariker had trouble finding a producer. Producers who showed interest in the script wanted budget cuts as well as script modifications. Eventually, Khan agreed to Gowariker's suggestion that he would produce the film. Khan corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Gowariker, the story and script of the film, and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce Lagaan. He also said that by being a producer himself, he was able to give greater creative freedom to Gowariker. He cited an example:\n Box office \"If the director tells the producer that he wants 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them.\" Critical reception Jhamu Sughand co-produced the film because he liked the emotional and patriotic story. Lagaan was made on a then-unprecedented budget of \u20b9250 million , the highest for an Indian film of the time.\n Awards Gowariker first thought of having Shah Rukh Khan, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan and Abhishek Bachchan for the role of Bhuvan. After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with J. P. Dutta's Refugee , Khan was approached with the idea.\n See also Several actresses had offered to act in the film, but Khan needed someone who matched the description of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates to accommodate the film, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das, Shamita Shetty and Ameesha Patel were approached for the role, Gowariker selected Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film. Since the script also demanded a British cast, Gowariker and Khan hired Danielle Roffe as one of the casting directors. After Danielle and Gowariker screen-tested many, Shelley and Blackthorne were chosen for the prime roles. Overall, the film cast 15 foreign actors.\n References Raghubir Yadav played the role of the legendary Haji Nasruddin in the teleplay Mullah Nasiruddin and has given many memorable performances such as Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne. Yadav was selected for the role of Bhura, a poultry farmer, based on his performance in Earth . He had undergone an appendectomy operation in-between the filming schedule and returned to complete some of his scenes. Rajesh Vivek, who played the fortune teller Guran, was spotted by Gowariker in the film Junoon . His liking for cricket helped him in his role. Raj Zutshi friendship with Khan and association in several films brought him the role of Ismail the potter after auditions. Pradeep Rawat's association with Khan in Sarfarosh  brought him the role of Deva, a Sikh ex-sepoy, which was initially intended for Mukesh Rishi. Rawat claimed that it was the highest ever compensation he received in his career. Daya Shankar Pandey, who preferred the role of Kachra, was known to Khan and Gowariker through previous films , Baazi  and Ghulam ). Pandey credited Gowariker for his acting in the film as Goli, saying that Gowariker and he would discuss the required emotions and expressions before shooting.\n Further reading Yashpal Sharma was chosen by Gowariker for the role of Lakha, the woodcutter, after his portrayal in Samar . He said it was a good experience working with Khan and Gowariker during the film. Amin Hajee earlier worked in a film with Gowariker. The friendly association brought Gowariker to him with the script, which he liked, and thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role of Bagha, a mute drummer. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped him better prepare for his role. Gowariker, who believed that Amin was like Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming. Aditya Lakhia's association with Gowariker in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa  and Pehla Nasha  brought him the role of Kachra, the untouchable. He read the book Everybody Loves a Good Drought by P. Sainath to better understand and portray his character.\n External links"

It opened to mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and audience, with praise for its adaptation to the new setting, faithfulness to the source material, depth, soundtrack, background score and emotion, but received criticism for Khan's performance. Against its \u20b9180 crore budget, the film generated a worldwide revenue of less than \u20b990 crore in its first week and was thus declared a box office bomb, although it became the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022 at international box office, earning more than Gangubai Kathiawadi and The Kashmir Files.\n Development In 2014, on a train bound for Karauli, a man named Laal Singh Chaddha recounts the story of his life to strangers who happen to sit next to him, while eating golgappas.

    "plot": "\n Plot Jersey is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language sports drama film written and directed by Gowtam Tinnanuri, being his Hindi directorial debut and the remake of his 2019 Telugu film of the same title. Cricket action was choreographed and directed by Rob Miller of ReelSports. It stars Shahid Kapoor as a former cricketer who returns to the game for his son's wish of buying a Jersey T- Shirt, alongside Mrunal Thakur and Pankaj Kapoor. The film is produced by Geetha Arts, Dil Raju Production, Sithara Entertainments and Brat Films.\n Cast Official announcement for the film was made in October 2019. Principal photography commenced in Chandigarh in December 2019 and ended in December 2020, amidst delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Jersey was originally scheduled for a cinema release on 28 August 2020 but was postponed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was theatrically released on 22 April 2022. Despite a positive reception from the critics and praise for Shahid Kapoor's performance, Jersey performed poorly at the box office.\n Production 26-year-old Arjun Talwar  is an extraordinary cricketer from Chandigarh with the highest batting average in all of India and 106 half-centuries, fifty-two centuries, nine double centuries and two triple centuries to his name. Following the 1985-86 Duleep Trophy finals, Arjun awaits news of his selection in the India national team, only to find out his inclusion in the list was a misprint. Following this, he quits cricket. Arjun then applies for a job in the food sector and shortly after marries his girlfriend Vidya , with whom he has a son named Ketan, nicknamed Kittu . However, sometime in the early 1990s, Arjun is suspended from his job on corruption charges, although he is innocent.\n Music In 1996, Arjun lives with Vidya and Kittu in a dilapidated house in Chandigarh, with Vidya struggling to make ends meet as a hotel receptionist. Kittu loves playing cricket, much like Arjun did, and wishes to get a jersey of the Indian national team for his upcoming birthday. Arjun tries getting one, but finds out it is very expensive; he then tries to loan the Jersey in vain and Vidya refuses to lend him money for the same. His friends try pooling funds for the jersey, but fall very short of the budget. Arjun's former coach Baali Sir  approaches him to inform him of an upcoming charity match between Punjab and New Zealand, with players' fees included. Arjun's friend lies that Arjun has agreed to  play, forcing Arjun to practice for the match late at night.\n Release The next day, the New Zealand team bats impressively and sets a high target for Punjab. At first, Punjab seems to be losing the match, with very few runs and wickets falling quick. Arjun is sent onto the pitch, hitting fours and sixes with ease. Although the Punjab team eventually loses the match by one run, Arjun is praised by many, especially Kittu, for his exceptional batting. However, he is dismayed to find out that players' fees are going to charity as well. Arjun, ashamed that he was unable to get his son a jersey, tells Baali Sir that he wants to get back up playing cricket.\n Home media Officials are skeptical about Arjun, a 36-year-old, playing cricket, thinking he will not do well and will quit again in a year or two. However, they then see him play during practice, amazed by how he is able to score easily. Selections for the upcoming Ranji Trophy are underway, with only 15 out of 30 of the trainees being selected. The results come in, and Arjun is ecstatic after finding out that his name in the list. The first few matches go well, with Arjun making centuries effortlessly and simultaneously earning his teammates' respect and teaching them some of his techniques. Meanwhile, Arjun's time on the field takes a toll on him, resulting in him having to go to the hospital for some tests. Although it is said he may not be able to play in the finals, Arjun nevertheless appears for the match against Karnataka at the Wankhede Stadium.\n Distribution In the second half of the match, he is pitted against Gowda, a bowler from the Karnataka team who has effortlessly taken wickets of batsmen who had played prior in the match. Gowda proves to be a challenge to Arjun, who however manages to get to a century. Gowda tries many tricks to take Arjun's wicket. However, this does not deter Arjun from scoring. In the final over, the team barely manages to score runs due to the opposition's strong bowling and Arjun being on the non-striker end. On the final ball, Arjun needing three runs to win, attempts to hit a sixer. Despite risking being run out, Arjun manages to make the required runs for his team to win the match and the trophy.\n Reception In 2022, Jasleen Shergill, a journalist who supported Arjun during his comeback, writes a biography about him titled Jersey. At a function relating to the book, it is revealed that recently, a list of players selected for the Indian national team headed to England was found, with Arjun's name included in it. A grown-up Ketan is then called upon stage to receive a jersey with Arjun's name on it, thus fulfilling his childhood dream of getting a jersey. Ketan reveals that shortly after the Ranji finals, Arjun had to be admitted to the hospital, succumbing to heart failure caused by arrythmia, something Arjun knew he had, but chose to keep it a secret and the reason why he had to quit cricket. Ketan then ends his speech by stating that while people believed his father lost his life while trying, it was the opposite; even during hardships, Arjun never backed down till the very end.\n Box office Speculations for a remake of the Telugu film Jersey  began soon after its release. Later it was reported that Shahid Kapoor has been roped in to star as the lead actor while Shraddha Kapoor was considered for the female lead. In August 2019, Kannada actress Rashmika Mandanna was considered to play the female lead in this film and it will be her Hindi debut film. Official announcement was made on 14 October that year, confirming all the cast and crew. But later Mrunal Thakur was finalised to cast in the movie Shahid's father Pankaj Kapur was roped in to portray Coach Murthy. The principal photography commenced on 14 December 2019 in Chandigarh.\n Critical response While filming in January 2020, it was reported that Shahid Kapoor received thirteen stitches during a scene, though he later recovered. The filming was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The filming was resumed in October 2020, production moved to Dehradun and filming took place at the all-boys' boarding school, The Doon School, and Kasiga School. Doon's cricket grounds, buildings and pavilion feature in the film and the trailer. The final schedule of the film took place at the Mohali Stadium in Punjab, and strict bio bubbles and quarantine rules were put in place for the safety of cast and crew. The filming wrapped up on 14 December 2020.\n References The film's songs are composed by Sachet\u2013Parampara while the lyrics are written by Shellee. The film score is composed by Anirudh Ravichander who composed the score and soundtrack for the original Telugu version. The film version of 'Jind Meriye' is sung by Javed Ali.

Set in Mathura, it is about a television reporter who cohabits with his headstrong intern and chaos ensues when their traditional families assume them to be married to each other.\n Cast The film was released on 1 March 2019 to a positive critical reception. It became a major financial success at the box office, grossing \u20b9128.60 crore  worldwide.\n Production Vishnu Trivedi, a failing politician in the small town of Mathura, campaigns to ban live-in relationships, seeing them as a disgrace to the Indian conservative culture. At the same time, his party begins to lead an all-out campaign against film star Nazeem Khan, who is allegegdly in a live-in relationship with his girlfriend, exactly the cause behind his grudge against live-in relationships.\n Release Vishnu's daughter Rashmi takes up an internship at a local news channel, and starts working with the channel's star reporter Vinod \"Guddu\" Shukla and his best friend, cameraman Abbas Sheikh. Guddu and Rashmi fall in love and Guddu proposes to her. Not ready for marriage, she suggests a live-in relationship, but he, being more traditional and somewhat scared of Vishnu, disagrees. As a compromise, Abbas suggests trying a live-in relationship during their 20-day business trip to Gwalior. The couple agree.\n Home media They rent an apartment in a conservative area by pretending to be a married couple. Eventually, they get closer and have sex several times. Their nosy neighbor, Mrs. Srivastava, sees them during one such act and becomes suspicious of their marital status. To further complicate problems, they mix-up their answers when asked about their wedding-date. She plans to gather the neighborhood to oust the couple next morning, but Guddu and Rashmi come up with fake photographs and wedding mementos overnight, leaving her plans adrift. At the end of twenty days, he reaffirms his love and she accepts his marriage proposal. Before they can leave Gwalior, Guddu's relative Babulal sees the two together, follows them, sees the wedding pictures, and assumes that they eloped.\n Music The next morning, Babulal brings Guddu's entire family to their house and they chastise him for eloping. Guddu and Rashmi, realising that the family would willingly accept a marriage but not a cohabitation, do not admit the truth. All of them go back to Mathura to meet Rashmi's family and tell them about it. Vishnu, however, is happy to hear that his daughter decided to get married instead of cohabiting. He even details the deadly consequences, should they have cohabited instead. Scared, the couple fails to admit the truth.\n Reception Although they begin living like a married couple, they resent the fact that they are not legally married. They make multiple attempts to get married in secret, but are intruded every time; in a last-ditch attempt, they try to get married in a mass marriage event. Vishnu, however, being the chief guest, catches them red-handed. Exasperated, they admit that they had been cohabiting. \n Critical response Once his family, too, catches up, Guddu reveals to Vishnu that the main reason for his loss in elections is his reluctance to change; since the majority of the voting group is the young generation, which believes in modernity, opposing the youth's methods would equal lack of support from them. He successfully convinces Vishnu to stop opposing live-in relationships and finally marries Rashmi with his blessings.\n Box office The story ends with Guddu and Rashmi covering a rally led by Vishnu, who is shown to have joined hands with Nazeem for his election campaign.\n Sequel Principal photography for the film began in Gwalior on 1 August 2018 and was completed in Mathura in September 2018.

The story revolves around two plus size women, one from the heartland of Uttar Pradesh and one from urban New Delhi, who discover themselves as they navigate life, celebrate female friendship and embrace body positivity, breaking the myth that beauty corresponds to size. \n Cast Double XL was released on November 4, 2022. It received negative reviews from critics.\n Soundtrack Two oversized, and talented women living in diagonally opposite parts of the world one in a small town Meerut, and the other in posh New Delhi, get lambasted from the world around them except for just one or two caring relatives. They decide to get together, and show the world what they can do with their talent. In their effort, they are joined by two young and handsome men, and the foursome begin producing something in London that can have the world gawking at them in admiration. They do succeed in the end.\n Reception The music is composed by Sohail Sen and Kanishk Seth while lyrics are written by Mudassar Aziz and Baba Bulle Shah.\n References The movie mostly received negative reviews. Shubhra Gupta for The Indian Express rate the movie 1.5/5 and wrote \"Double XL is a massive opportunity wasted. Crashing pity.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV also rated the movie 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"Double XL, with its one-size-fits-all approach, translates into more than just double trouble.\" Anuj Kumar for The Hindu wrote \"More of an essay on body-shaming than a piece of cinema, Double XL is yet another example of good intentions leading to a drab film. \"The makers seem so focused on raising the issue and reflecting diversity on screen, that they seem to have forgotten that the noble idea needs to be packaged into a compelling story as well.\" Suchin Mehrotra for Hindustan Times wrote \"Rounding off the group is London-based line producer Zorawar Khan . A painfully animated Zaheer seems to be in his own movie entirely as Zorawar, or as he introduces himself - Zo Za Zoo. I wish I was joking.\" Tushar Joshi for India Today rated 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The sentiment of the filmmaker is to encourage women to embrace their bodies irrespective of the size, frame, and to self-love to free themselves from the shackles of social stigma. Unfortunately, this task feels half-baked and a bit of a misfire in the attempt to give the film a tone of commercial acceptance.\" Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote \"One of the high points in Double XL is when Rajshri\u2019s mother  shrieks at her: what was your dream, when did you have it and pray why?\"\n External links"

    "plot": "  Plot Dil Dhadakne Do  is a 2015 Indian Hindi-language comedy drama film directed by Zoya Akhtar and produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar under the Excel Entertainment banner. The film stars an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh, Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar with a voice-over performance and narration by Aamir Khan. The supporting cast includes Rahul Bose, Zarina Wahab, Vikrant Massey, Pawan Chopra, Parmeet Sethi, Dolly Mattdo and Manoj Pahwa. The film tells the story of the Mehras, a dysfunctional family who invite their family and friends on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents' 30th wedding anniversary and later reconcile.  Cast Zoya conceived the film as a family drama centered on a brother-sister relationship. She wanted to depict a more realistic sibling relationship in contrast to the dubious and over-the-top portrayal for which Bollywood is known. She later wrote the script with her friend and longtime collaborator Reema Kagti, while Farhan penned the dialogues. Much of the principal photography was done on Pullmantur Cruises' ship MS Sovereign while sailing across the Mediterranean and Europe, and on land in France, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and Italy.  Production The soundtrack was composed by the trio Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. The film was released worldwide on 5 June 2015 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Kapoor, Shah, Chopra and Singh, who portrayed the members of the Mehra family, as well as Akhtar's direction, the film's music, cinematography and costumes, but it received criticism for its running time and climax. Nevertheless, it proved to be a commercial success, having grossed \u20b91.44 billion  on a budget of \u20b9550 million .  Development At the 61st Filmfare Awards, Dil Dhadakne Do received 5 nominations, including Best Supporting Actress , winning Best Supporting Actor . It also received 9 nominations at the 2016 Screen Awards, including Best Film and Best Director , and won 2 awards \u2013 Best Supporting Actor  and Best Ensemble Cast.  Casting and characters Kamal Mehra, a billionaire businessman in Delhi owns AyKa, a company on the verge of bankruptcy, and has a troubled relationship with his wife Neelam, daughter Ayesha and son Kabir. Ayesha has a successful travel business in Mumbai, but is unhappy with her marriage to the narcissistic and controlling Manav Sangha who along with his mother Smita hates her family. Unwillingly Kabir takes part in the business, instead dreaming of becoming a pilot. Kamal and Neelam invite their family and friends for a cruise across the Mediterranean Sea to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary.  Filming Their guests include the Sood family. Kamal and Neelam plan Kabir's wedding to the Soods' daughter Noorie, in exchange to her father Lalit investing in AyKa, aiming to prevent bankruptcy. Aboard, Kabir falls in love with ship performer and dancer Farah Ali. Noorie falls for Rana, the son of the Soods' sworn rival Khannas. Ayesha wishes to divorce Manav. Sunny Gill, the son of Kamal's manager Amrish enters aboard. Sunny is a childhood friend of Ayesha and Kabir, and he and Ayesha were in love as teenagers. However, Kamal had paid for and arranged Sunny's Yale University scholarship to separate him from Ayesha. Ayesha and Sunny, now a successful journalist, still harbor feelings for each other. Unlike Manav, Sunny appreciates Ayesha's strong personality and is a feminist.  Soundtrack Neelam sees Kamal flirting with a local guest and wonders why she did not divorce him despite his past infidelities. Ayesha confronts Sunny about their separation and kisses him, which shocks them both. Farah hears that Kabir is going to marry Noorie and storms off. Kamal sees Noorie making out with Rana and learns that Kabir and Noorie are not together as he had thought, causing him to have a gas attack.  Release Kabir reveals to his family that he is in love with Farah and intends to leave the family business. He asks them to consider Ayesha, who is actually interested in business. When he tries to persuade them to let her proceed with her divorce, Kamal and Neelam refuse, believing marriages are lifelong commitments. Infuriated, Kabir bursts out that they are hypocrites for talking of marriage, values, and morals, as the whole family circle is aware of Kamal's adultery and that Neelam has been suffering silently for years. Kamal asks Neelam why she had not left him; she reveals she had no choice because her family would not accept her back due to dishonour. Kamal realises his mistake and asks for Neelam's forgiveness. While trying to reconcile Manav and Ayesha, Kamal sees how his son-in-law mistreats his daughter and orders him and Smita to leave, finally agreeing to the divorce and apologizing to his daughter.  Reception Farah is dismissed from her job for being romantically involved with a passenger and told to leave the ship. Kabir learns about her dismissal after the ship has set sail. He breaks news of Ayesha's now-impending divorce to Sunny, and after publicly rejecting his impending marriage to Noorie, jumps off the ship to swim to shore, believing his family will rescue him. Kamal, Neelam, Ayesha scramble aboard a lifeboat and go after him with the help of their friends. While leaving, Ayesha asks Sunny if he will wait for her, to which he replies \"forever\". The family rescues Kabir and head toward shore to help him find Farah while being chased by the ship's crew. The Mehra family is seen happy in each other's presence for the first time.  Box office The cast is listed below: Accolades When Excel Entertainment announced its upcoming films in March 2012, one of them was Zoya Akhtar's next film following Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara . It was reported that she was working on a script and that filming was due to start in December 2012. Akhtar dismissed the reports, saying she was yet to start writing her next script. In May that year, media reports suggested Akhtar was already writing her next film. That July, it was reported the script was about siblings partially based on Akhtar and her brother Farhan Akhtar. Farhan Akhtar later denied reports of the film being autobiographical, saying it had nothing to do with their real life relationship and that it is entirely a work of fiction. In November 2012, Akhtar said she was still writing the script and that the film was a family drama. References Akhtar co-wrote the screenplay with her long-time friend and collaborator Reema Kagti. Akhtar had always aspired to make a family drama with a brother-sister relationship at its core. She felt such topics not been well represented in Indian films, and that the brother-sister relationship bond has always been shown \"wrapped in rituals\" and never portrayed as it really is. She believed the theme of brother-sister relationships \"generally have cheesy representations. They are never at ease. This is one of the most important relationships in the world because nobody else shares your parents. I wanted to show that relationship in Dil Dhadakne Do.\" Akhtar also wanted to showcase the quirkiness of a dysfunctional family, with different layers to each family member, saying, \"the beauty of families lies in their flaws\".

During production, the film was initially titled Talli and later Ek Tha Talli before being changed to PK as the latter title was found to be too similar to Ek Tha Tiger . The film's soundtrack was composed by Shantanu Moitra, Ajay\u2013Atul and Ankit Tiwari with lyrics written by Swanand Kirkire, Amitabh Varma and Manoj Muntashir. UTV Motion Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures acquired the distribution rights of the film. PK was the first Bollywood film to be shot in Belgium.\n Production PK was released on 19 December 2014.

At the time of its release, it emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of all time. The film's final worldwide gross was \u20b9769.89 crore . It currently stands as the 8th highest grossing Indian film of all time. and 9th highest-grossing film in India.\n Development A humanoid alien lands on Earth naked on a research mission in Rajasthan but is stranded when the remote control for his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in Belgium, an Indian woman, Jagat Janani Sahni alias Jaggu, meets a Pakistani, Sarfaraz Yousuf, and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father objects to their relationship, citing difference in their religions. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the wedding due to cultural differences.\n Casting Jaggu returns to India and becomes a news reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's collection box as a refund on God's broken promises. The alien tells her that he is an 'astronaut' from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication; they transfer ideas by holding hands.\n Characters A flashback shows how, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh, who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute Phuljhadiya's hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. The alien begins speaking, and after learning of the whole scenario, Bhairon tells him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behaviour, people assume he is drunk and call him \"peekay\" or \"PK\" ; the alien adopts PK as a name . People tell PK that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. He sincerely practices Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find \"God\", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.\n Title PK conjectures, as Jaggu plays a prank on an unknown caller, that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a \"wrong number\" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen by sending their videos to her news channel. This \"wrong number\" campaign turns into a popular mass movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a \"wrong number\". Bhairon brings the thief to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack.\n Themes Tapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.\n Filming Jaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy receptionist tells her that Sarfaraz has been annoying the embassy officials by repeatedly asking if they received a call from Delhi, implying that he still loves Jaggu. That day, Sarfaraz found the same letter and thought it was from Jaggu, and did not call her as he understood she was under familial pressure. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced by Jaggu's father to return PK's remote.\n Marketing Meanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. He lies to Jaggu that the tapes contain a variety of Earthly noises which he will miss, such as crows and car horns. Jaggu realises his love for her by seeing the note he wrote for her earlier but does not directly confront him about it. PK does not even look back while going as he doesn't want her to see him in tears which will give away his love for her. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him, with Sarfaraz and her family assisting.\n PK: The Game One year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with more members of his species.\n Release \"PK\" was the only film which began with a desire to say something. I can't say what that thing is. The battle was the other way round\u2014how do you say such a serious thing in an entertaining way? For many years, we were struggling, until we finally found a way, where it will be entertaining, won't be offensive\u2014will hit the right notes, basically.\n Distribution \u2014Rajkumar Hirani, director of pk, in an interview to India Insight.\n Soundtrack After the success of 3 Idiots, director Rajkumar Hirani and writer Abhijat Joshi started work for the next project. They had written a story about a character who had the ability to get into another person's mind to make that person a better human being. They spent one year to write a story, but it turned out to be similar to Inception . After watching Inception, Hirani and Joshi were shocked by the similarities. Eventually, they decided to scrap the film, then Hirani and Joshi reworked on the script, changing the entire tone and angle. It took five years to make the film and three years to write it.\n Track listing In PK, Khan played nine avatars and, during the course of the film, the actor had to chew over 10,000 betelnut preparations called paan.\u200a Betelnut is a psychoactive stimulant used throughout Asia and characterized by its ability to stain users' mouths red. \"In real life paan is not a habit, I have it once in a while but for this film I chew paan for every scene. I would at times eat about 100 paans in a day. We had a paanwala  on the sets,\" said Khan in the report. For every take, Khan had to eat a fresh paan to fill his mouth. Before beginning the shoot, he would eat at least 10\u201315 paans to get the right color inside his mouth and on his lips.\n Reception Viral Thakkar was the visual effects supervisor. The visual effects company was Riva Digital at a point employing 100 artists working on the film.\n Box office In 2011, Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma signed on for the film. Khan's nephew Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were considered for a role which eventually went to Sushant Singh Rajput before the release of his debut movie Kai Po Che . Earlier reports said that Rajkumar Hirani had signed Arshad Warsi for the film when it was reported that Arshad will be playing an important role. In 2013, Warsi said in an interview \"I couldn't have worked out on dates. I wouldn't refuse Raju for anything. In fact, when he offered me the film, I did not even ask for the script, I was like I am ready to come on whenever you want. So that is the connection I share with Raju.\" Before Rajput and Warsi were signed on, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were said to be cast in the film. Junaid Khan, son of Aamir Khan worked as an assistant director in this film.\n Domestic In 2011, in its initial scripting stage, Hirani named the film Talli, then changed it to Ek Tha Talli which he loved, but later on came to know that Ek Tha Tiger was already in production . He dropped the idea and, after many titles, he came up with a title that only had initials, PK. After starting the film, Hirani felt PK was not a good enough title. He decided to change the title to Talli. But after a few weeks of shooting, Hirani decided to go back to the original title.\n International Firstpost compared PK to Hirani and Khan's previous collaboration 3 Idiots, as they both involve \"A socially awkward and 'different' young man\u2014who walks and talks in a strange, enthusiastic childlike manner\u2014observes the system, questions it, asks you to look at the many ludicrous things that inform it, and eventually brings about a minor revolution.\"\n East Asia According to Hirani, PK is a \"satire on Hindu gods and their godmen\". The co-director Khan began looking for shooting locations in July 2012. Second unit filming was set to begin in late 2012, which was stalled after the rumoured departure of three department heads for the film and bad weather stalling initial shoots. Hirani denied rumours that the film would be delayed, stating that principal filming had always been intended to begin in mid-January 2013 in Delhi and Rajasthan to \"capture the winter of Delhi\".\n Records Shooting officially began on 1 February 2013, with the filming scheduled to occur over a 45-day period. A one-week schedule of shooting of PK was in June 2013 in Bruges, Belgium. A 26-day schedule of shooting of PK started in Delhi from 27 September 2013.\n Awards and nominations The film was marketed by a Mumbai Based company named Spice PR owned by Prabhat Choudhary.\n Sequel The makers released a teaser trailer on 23 October 2014. It achieved 3.4\u00a0million views on YouTube within five days, subsequently receiving 12 million views. It was regarded as the most viewed movie trailers on YouTube. The teaser was attached with the film Happy New Year .\n Controversies In August, the makers found a new promotional strategy to interact with the audiences by introducing talking standees. This was the first time a Bollywood film used a talking standee at varied locations as a part of its promotions. The standee had Khan talking to people in a prominent places in popular theatres and multiplexes.\n See also On 7 December 2014, Khan began the city tour for promotions with Patna. The character he plays speaks in Bhojpuri which is the main language used for communication in Bihar. Aamir said at the event \"I have decided to launch the promotional campaign of my film PK from Bihar to connect with the language. My character speaks Bhojpuri in the film.\" Hence, the actor decided to start his promotional schedule from Bihar. Although he wanted to visit Bhojpur, which is 60 kilometers from Bihar, he could not because of security issues. In Bihar he visited a litti chokha stall. The visit resulted in a surge of customers to the shop, and the shop owner put up pictures of Khan eating the local delicacy. Then the crew proceeded to Varanasi where they had a screening of their film 3 Idiots and interacted with the people. Khan made an impromptu visit to Krishana Paan shop to savor a Banarasi pan. The actor specially removed time from his schedule to visit this place. He enjoyed a \"mitha banarasi paan\" there. After the crew visited Delhi, Ahemdabad, Raipur, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Indore, Bangalore and other locations in India. Aamir and makers also promoted the film in Dubai.\n Citations Indiagames, a part of Disney India's Interactive business, announced the launch of the official mobile game 'PK' based on the film.

She dreams of directing her own films. Blunt and cynical, she is most comfortable when with her three best friends, Fatima, Jackie and Ganju, all of whom dream big and make up for the banality of their day jobs by making sure that their evenings and nights are glamourous and modern, fast and loose. Kaira's life takes a downturn when she casually sleeps with Raghuvendra, a film producer, and then breaks up with her childhood sweetheart Sid, a rest-o-bar owner.

    "plot": "\n Plot Kabir Singh is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film written and directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and jointly produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar under T-Series Films and Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde under Cine1 Studios. A remake of Vanga's own Telugu film Arjun Reddy , it stars Shahid Kapoor in the titular role as a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend, Preeti, played by Kiara Advani, marries someone else. Adil Hussain, Nikita Dutta, Arjan Bajwa, Suresh Oberoi, Dolly Minhas, Suparna Marwah, Anurag Arora, Soham Majumdar, Kunal Thakur, Anusha Sampath, Amit Sharma and Kamini Kaushal feature in supporting roles.\n Cast Principal photography for Kabir Singh began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews with criticism directed at it glamorising misogyny and toxic masculinity, though Kapoor's performance and the soundtrack, which has become popular since release, received acclaim.  Grossing over \u20b9370 crore, it became the third highest grossing Bollywood film of 2019, and Kapoor's highest grossing solo-lead release. It became the 26th highest grossing Indian film of all time.\n Production Kabir Rajdheer Singh, a house surgeon at the Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences, suffers from severe anger management problems that gain him the reputation of a bully. After a brawl, Kabir is told to either apologize or leave, but chooses to stays upon catching sight of a new student, Preeti Sikka.\n Development Later, Kabir and his friends announce to the student body that Kabir has exclusively claimed Preeti. Initially timid, she adjusts to his overbearing attitude and eventually reciprocates his feelings, developing an intimate relationship with him. Kabir graduates with an MBBS degree and moves to Mussoorie for post-graduation. Despite the distance, their relationship strengthens over the next few years. After Preeti graduates, she introduces Kabir to her conservative parents, but her father Harpal catches them kissing and throws Kabir out.\n Writing Harpal continues to oppose their relationship, despite Kabir's attempts to explain their love. Enraged, Kabir demands that Preeti choose between him and her family within the next six hours, or he will end their relationship. Preeti fails to reach back to him in time; feeling abandoned, Kabir injects himself with morphine and remains unconscious for the next two days. Upon gaining consciousness, he learns that Preeti is being forced into an arranged marriage and gatecrashes the wedding party; Harpal has him beaten and arrested. After Kabir is released, his father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family for his antics.\n Casting With his friend Shiva\u2019s help, Kabir finds a rented flat and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he abuses drugs and alcohol, attempts one-night stands, has casual relationships, and names his new pet dog Preeti \u2014 none of which are successful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a high-functioning alcoholic both respected and feared by the hospital staff. His self-destructive behaviour and obsession worry his friends.\n Filming While hungover on a day-off, Kabir is called in to perform an emergency surgery for which he unwillingly agrees. During the procedure, he collapses from dehydration. Suspicious, the hospital staff takes his blood samples, which contain traces of alcohol and cocaine. A case is filed against him and during an in-house hearing, a broken Kabir admits to alcoholism and violation of medical ethics. As a result, his medical license is suspended for five years and he is evicted from his flat. The next morning, he learns of his grandmother\u2019s death; at the funeral, he and his father reconcile. Kabir also resolves to quit his habits.\n Soundtrack Some days later, Kabir spots a pregnant but dejected Preeti sitting in a park. He approaches and offers to raise the child with her if she is unhappy in her marriage. Initially silent, she bursts into angry tears, berates him for discarding her, and ordering him to leave. Shiva then describes Kabir's obsession and self-destructive habits, which she was unaware of. Shocked, she confesses that she left her husband three days after the marriage and has been working in a clinic to support herself. Overcome with anger, especially after hearing about his casual affairs, she had refused to contact him. She reveals that her marriage was never consummated and that the child is Kabir\u2019s. They marry and reunite with their families, with Harpal apologizing to them and the families coming together. The film ends with them on their honeymoon, on a beach, with their baby.\n Marketing After the success of his debut, the 2017 Telugu film Arjun Reddy, writer and director Sandeep Reddy Vanga wanted to remake it in Hindi with Ranveer Singh. When it did not work out, he approached Shahid Kapoor. However, producers Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde of Cine1 Studios, who acquired the remake rights for Hindi, wanted Arjun Kapoor to play the male lead. Disappointed, Vanga said, \"I've come to know that the remake rights of Arjun Reddy have been sold and it would star Arjun Kapoor. I am caught in a dilemma, as I've already locked Shahid for the role. It's a very embarrassing situation for me. I don't know how I'll face Shahid.\" In April 2018, however, it was officially announced that Shahid Kapoor would star, with Vanga returning as director.\n Release Bhushan and Krishan Kumar of T-Series also produced the film. The dialogue was written by Siddharth\u2013Garima. Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran was selected as the cinematographer and Aarif Sheikh as editor. Vanga was confident that the remake would be even more hard-hitting than the original: \"When I made Arjun Reddy, I wasn't sure where to draw the line in terms of representation of certain things. I don't think I'd have to restrict myself when it comes to the Hindi version. I believe I'll have more freedom in Bollywood.\" The film's title Kabir Singh was announced on 25 October 2018.\n Reception Like the Telugu original, Kabir Singh too begins with a voiceover from the hero's paternal grandmother, but this time she is reciting a Kabir Doha. There are also geographical changes; the remake is set primarily in Delhi and Mumbai. Instead of caste conflict as in Arjun Reddy, the heroine's father takes offence to Kabir's smoking and not being a turban-wearing Sikh. For the remake, Vanga said he deployed less English than the original. \"I've also tried to retain the colloquial quality in the Hindi dialogue.\" About the name Kabir Singh, he said, \"There's a lot of melancholy in the name Kabir and a poetic side too.\" Vanga explained his reasons for choosing this as the film's title: \"When we started work on the Hindi script, it was a very exciting journey. Kabir Singh, as the protagonist's name, came naturally, considering the character's graph. Kabir Singh has the same punch and madness of Arjun Reddy.\"\n Critical response Shahid Kapoor portrays the title character, Kabir Rajdheer Singh. Although Kiara Advani was Vanga's first choice for the female lead character Preeti, things failed to materialise. Tara Sutaria was then announced, but left when a delay in the production of her debut film Student of the Year 2  caused scheduling conflicts. The makers then went back to Advani to play the role of Preeti, Vanga cited her performance in M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story  as one of the reasons. According to Vanga, \"Kiara epitomises the female character in the film to the T. She has the perfect combination of innocence  and maturity  that's so important for the character\". Arjan Bajwa was initially uninterested in playing Kabir's elder brother Karan Singh, but accepted at the insistence of Vanga, for whom he was the only choice to play the character. Amit Sharma, who appeared as Amit in the Telugu original, was chosen to reprise his role.\n Box office The makers considered beginning the shoot in August, but it was delayed to September as Vanga wanted Kapoor to grow his beard more for the role. Principal photography eventually began on 21 October 2018 at Mumbai, four days before the announcement of the title. Filming also took place at Delhi and Mussoorie. Kapoor dons three different looks for the film. Regarding this he said, \"There's a certain mind space and the present which the character is in and there's also the past which he has been part of. Along with this, there's the culmination. So, there are three distinct energies that the film needs.\" He went through substantial workouts to portray Kabir in two time periods; to achieve the character's \"college boy\" look, he shed 14 kilos of weight, and for the \"puffy, groggy alcoholic\" look, he worked out in a way that he would look \"bigger but not muscular\". Principal photography wrapped on 29 March 2019.\n Home media The soundtrack is composed by Mithoon, Amaal Mallik, Vishal Mishra, Sachet\u2013Parampara  and Akhil Sachdeva with lyrics written by Irshad Kamil, Manoj Muntashir, Kumaar and Mithoon. Harshavardhan Rameshwar composed the score. The song \"Bekhayali\" was popular even before its release, with several cover versions available on YouTube.\n Awards and nominations In a first-of-its-kind marketing deal, Kabir Singh became the first Bollywood film to have its very own theatre. As many as 15 PVR theatres in 15 cities across India would be renamed as \"Kabir Singh Ka Theatre\", with auditoriums reflecting the characteristics of the title character played by Kapoor.\n References Kabir Singh was released on 21 June 2019, worldwide on 3616 screens including 3123 screens in India. It is distributed by AA Films within India. Khetani chose not to release the film in Pakistan, following the 2019 Pulwama attack. The film received an 'A'  certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification  with the CBFC asking the makers to modify a scene where a character is seen snorting drugs, and also asked for insertion of static warning messages against drug abuse in all such scenes.\n External links"

    "plot": "Brothers is a 2009 American psychological drama war film directed by Jim Sheridan and written by David Benioff. A remake of the 2004 Danish film, it follows Captain Sam Cahill , a presumed-dead prisoner of the War in Afghanistan who deals with extreme PTSD while reintegrating into society following his release from captivity. The film also stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Cahill's brother and Natalie Portman as his wife. Both films take inspiration from Homer's epic poem the Odyssey.\n Plot The film received a mixed response and grossed $43 million. Maguire, however, received particular praise for his performance, receiving a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama.\n Cast In October 2007, United States Marine Corps captain Sam Cahill is about to embark on his fourth combat deployment to Afghanistan. He is married to his high school sweetheart Grace, and together they raise two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie. Sam's brother, Tommy, is a convicted felon who is released from prison on parole a few days before Sam\u2019s deployment. At a family dinner with Tommy and Sam's parents, Hank and Elsie, Maggie reveals to Tommy that Grace dislikes him, and Hank insults Tommy for his lack of success compared to Sam.\n Reception During Sam's tour, his Blackhawk helicopter is shot down in Helmand Province. Sam and private Joe Willis are the sole survivors and are taken prisoner by Taliban fighters. Sam and Joe are declared killed in action by the U.S. government. At Sam's funeral, Hank attempts to drive Elsie and the girls home while drunk, but Tommy stops him. Hank again berates Tommy; and Tommy blames Hank for influencing Sam to join the Marines because of his own Vietnam War service.\n Box office Tommy attempts to redeem himself and completes a kitchen remodel for Grace. Hank and Tommy also mend their relationship, and Grace bonds with Tommy, aided by his growing paternal connection with Isabelle and Maggie. Grace and Tommy share a fireside kiss, but do not take their attraction any further. However, Tommy continues to remain close with the family and his nieces grow attached to him. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are tortured by their captors and Sam is eventually forced to beat Joe to death.\n Critical response Sometime later, Sam is rescued by American forces and returns home, where he struggles to readjust, showing signs of severe post-traumatic stress disorder; his daughters grow fearful and resentful toward him. Sam also lies to Joe's widow about her husband's death. His paranoia also causes him to believe Grace and Tommy fell in love while he was gone, causing him to remain aloof. During Maggie's birthday party, Isabelle is rude to her sister and jealously complains that Maggie got what she wanted for her birthday, while Isabelle did not. Isabelle scolds Sam for being in Afghanistan during her birthday, but being able to attend Maggie\u2019s. Isabelle then begins to play with a balloon loudly, despite objections from Sam and Grace, until Sam snaps and pops the balloon out of fury.  Already scared and resentful of Sam's erratic behavior and violent mood swings, an angry and hurt Isabelle falsely claims that Tommy and Grace are having an affair and tells Sam that she wishes he had actually died. Returning home, believing his daughter\u2019s story, Sam becomes enraged, and proceeds to destroy the kitchen with a crowbar while screaming at Grace. When Tommy suddenly shows up, he attempts to bring Sam into an embrace, trying to calm his brother's violent breakdown, while Grace isolates her daughters from their father. However, Sam immediately becomes defensive when he realizes that Tommy has called the police.\n Accolades The police arrive and enter a standoff with Sam, who fires his  gun into the air and demands that the police kill him, before holding the gun to his own head, contemplating killing himself. He reluctantly surrenders after several pleas from Tommy and Grace. He is arrested and admitted to a Department of Veterans' Affairs mental hospital. Grace visits, giving him an ultimatum that if he does not tell her what happened, he will lose her forever. Sam finally confides in her that he killed Joe and they embrace. In narration, he wonders if he will ever be able to live a normal life again.\n Home media On its opening weekend, the film opened #3 with $9,527,848 behind New Moon and The Blind Side. Since its box office debut the film has grossed $43,318,349 worldwide.\n Opera adaptation Brothers received mixed reviews from film critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 159 reviews, with an average score of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It plays more like a traditional melodrama than the Susanne Bier film that inspired it, but Jim Sheridan's Brothers benefits from rock-solid performances by its three leads.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 31 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n References Tobey Maguire received critical acclaim for his dramatic performance; Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars and wrote that Brothers is \"Tobey Maguire's film to dominate, and I've never seen these dark depths in him before.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today observed the resemblance between Maguire and Gyllenhaal, and praised their onscreen chemistry. Regarding Portman's performance, Puig opined that it was \"subdued and reactive\". Writing for New York magazine, David Edelstein praised the three main actors: \"Sheridan's actors work with their intellects fully engaged\u2014and they engage us on levels we barely knew we had.\" He also complimented the cinematography and Sheridan's ability to pull the reader into the plot. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman gave the film a rating of C+, writing, \"Brothers isn't badly acted, but as directed by the increasingly impersonal Jim Sheridan, it\u2019s lumbering and heavy-handed, a film that piles on overwrought dramatic twists until it begins to creak under the weight of its presumed significance.\"\n External links"

Badree.\n Cast Phantom Films which owned the rights for the film, with its co-producers Madhu Mantena and Vishnu Vardhan Induri formally met the Indian squad of 1983 during mid-July 2016, and its frontman Kapil Dev, where they signed a Memorandum of understanding  to make the official biopic. In September 2017, Reliance Entertainment joined the film's producers and officially announced the biopic with members of the winning team, where Singh and Khan brought on board. Following an extensive casting and pre-production process, the film began principal photography on 5 June 2019, where it was majorly shot in and around England for three months and a brief schedule took place in India, before filming being wrapped up on 7 October.\n Production Earlier locked for cinema release in April 2020, the film was pushed from its release date several times due to the casting and pre-production works that delayed filming, and also due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, thus resulting the film to be delayed entirely till 2021. It premiered at the Red Sea International Film Festival on 15 December and released worldwide on 24 December 2021  in conventional 2D and 3D formats, distributed by Reliance Entertainment and PVR Pictures in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam languages, apart from the original version. The film received critical acclaim from critics and audiences alike, praising the performances of the cast, screenplay, direction and technical aspects. Despite the positive reviews, the film was unsuccessful at the Indian box office, although it became the highest grossing Hindi film of 2021 in overseas.\n Origin At the 67th Filmfare Awards, 83 received 14 nominations, including Best Director , Best Supporting Actor  and Best Male Playback Singer , and won 2 awards \u2013 Best Actor  and Best Lyricist .\n Development The film begins with a black-and-white opening sequence of the 1983 Cricket World Cup Final on 25 June 1983 between India and West Indies. During the second innings when India is fielding, Madan Lal bowls toward Viv Richards who is on strike. Richards lofts the ball in the air for a six but results in getting caught out by Kapil Dev.\n Casting The film then shifts to 30 May 1983 at the BCCI office in Mumbai where the BCCI officials get an invitation to the Cricket World Cup. Sunil Gavaskar is dropped from captaincy and Kapil Dev is made the captain. The cricketers who are in the squad namely Dev, Mohinder Amarnath, Kirti Azad, Madan Lal, and Sunil Valson are already there in England playing County Cricket.\n Pre-production Along with the team manager PR Man Singh, the rest of the team which includes Gavaskar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Syed Kirmani, Sandeep Patil, Dilip Vengsarkar, Yashpal Sharma, Roger Binny, Ravi Shastri and Balwinder Singh Sandhu reach London where they witness the West Indies Cricket Team the two-time World Cup winners, being hounded by photographers at the airport. After they reach the hotel they join the rest of their teammates.\n Filming The team fails horribly during the four warm-up matches which leads to doubts being raised about the performance of the Indian team in the Group Stage of the World Cup itself. During the press conference, Dev confidently tells the reporters that his team is here to win. During a training session of the West Indies team, the Indian team witnesses their four deadly fast bowlers namely Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall, and Joel Garner who were known for delivering deadly bouncers to the batsmen. At the ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the Queen wishes the teams luck and the teams proceed for a group photograph. On the way back to their hotel on the bus, Dev gives an inspirational speech during the team meeting in accentuated English.\n Music The World Cup starts with India being placed in Group B alongside the strong teams Australia and West Indies. Zimbabwe who turns out to be making their World Cup debut is also placed in the same group. India unexpectedly win their first match against West Indies by 34 runs at Old Trafford, Manchester with Yashpal Sharma being the Player of the Match for his contribution of 89 runs . \n Marketing The teammates later celebrate at a bar that night. They also manage to win their next match against Zimbabwe by 5 wickets at Grace Road, Leicester thereby leading to the rise in the expectations of the Indian fans. Patil scores a half-century and Madan Lal is named as the Player of the Match. \n Release However, the team becomes over-confident and loses their next match against Australia by a huge margin of 162 runs. Dev is disappointed with the team's performance, especially with Roger's performance, and Gavaskar is unable to play due to his leg injury.\n Theatrical With Gavaskar's absence, the following match with West Indies turns out to be a brutal one as in the first innings, Viv Richards thrashes out the Indian bowlers severely thereby making a score of 119 runs off 146 deliveries. The second innings seems to be more violent when Malcolm Marshall bowls deadly bouncers to the Indian batsmen and one of the bouncers hits Dilip Vengsarkar on his chin, injuring him. Mohinder Amarnath puts up a score of 80 runs by bravely facing the bouncers but India lose the match by 66 runs. \n Screenings The morale of the team is shattered. It is further shattered as Vengsarkar is ruled out from remaining World Cup matches due to his injury which resulted in seven stitches. The disheartened team in the bus is stuck on the route because of the West Indies crowd celebrating and blocking the way. However, they see a young Indian boy waving a homemade Indian flag which moves the team to tears and raises their spirits.\n Statistics The next match against Zimbabwe on 18 June at Trent Bridge, Nottingham is a do-or-die one as India will be eliminated from the tournament if they lose. The wives of the cricketers also turn up to show their support as it is thought to be their last match. Gavaskar is back in the team recovering from his injury. India opens up with a shaky start, making 9 runs at the cost of 4 wickets. Dev steps in a hurry onto the field without the helmet as he was taking a shower. While walking to the pitch he sees the disheartened Indian crowd. He then starts scoring runs but the wickets keep falling. During the lunch break, Dev takes out the Mongoose bat which enables him to hit more powerful shots and gives a better counterattack to the bowlers. He then starts hitting boundaries continuously. Dev then makes a world record of 175 runs  and is received with a standing ovation from the crowd and the umpire. India makes a score of 266 runs which Zimbabwe fail to achieve which leads to India winning the match by 31 runs and also retaining their place in the tournament.\n Controversies A party is held by the High Commissioner in which all the team members show up except for Binny who does not turn up because he is disappointed by Dev constantly chiding him for his bowling performance during net practice. At the party, Srikkanth jokes around and humorously tells the crowd that Dev had gone mad because he told them that they would beat the West Indies which is the strongest team in the cricketing world, but then he says that he has faith in his captain and he would only go home with winning the World Cup.\n Worldwide distribution The final Group Stage Match with Australia at County Ground, Chelmsford on 20 June is an easy win for India as they win by a huge margin of 118 runs with Binny being the Player of the Match for his contribution of taking 4 wickets, praises Captain. India qualifies for the semi-final and this creates a wave of excitement across the country as India managed to qualify for the semi-final for the first time. The Prime Minister Indira Gandhi orders her ministry to ensure that every town and village in the country gets a television service so that the semi-final match can be broadcast. \n Home media and streaming services Before the semi-final, Sandhu is disappointed as his engagement with his fianc\u00e9e Simran has been called off because of his living conditions and low salary. This affects his performance in the semi-final.\n Reception During the semi-final with England, Amarnath and Kirti Azad choke off England's supply of runs by taking wickets. Azad takes the wicket of Ian Botham in which the ball surprisingly spins low towards the ground. England is restricted to a score of 213 all out. In the second inning Amarnath and Sharma build up runs for India, however, Amarnath is run out. During the partnership of Dev and Patil when 4 runs are needed to win, there is a premature invasion on the field by Indian fans. This causes the English captain Bob Willis to set his fielders on the left side so that they can escape if there is another invasion. Patil hits a four and India qualifies for the finals of the 1983 World Cup. Amarnath is named the Player of the Match.\n Critical response This creates further excitement back in India as this win was seemed as unexpected one. On 25 June at Lords, India faces the West Indies again for the final with the latter winning the toss and choosing to bowl. In the beginning, Indian batsmen are restricted severely by the bowlers with Gavaskar getting dismissed for 1 run, but Srikkanth aggressively scores 38 runs making him the highest scorer for the Indian team. However, the team is all out for 183 making it the lowest score in the World Cup final. Dev inspires his team to restrict the West Indies batsmen from scoring runs. \n Box office The team steps onto the field with a rousing reception in the common room. In the second inning, Sandhu takes the wicket of Gordon Greenidge which gives India a lead. However, Richards launches a barrage of boundaries especially when Madan Lal is bowling. Madan Lal asks Dev to let him bowl another over as Richards underestimates him and Dev gives him another over to bowl. He bowls to Richards and Richards lofts in the air for six  but is caught out by Dev. This proves to be the turning point of the match. With Richards dismissed, the wickets of West Indies fall rapidly with Amarnath taking 3 wickets. When West Indies are 9 wickets down, Amarnath bowls to Holding who's the last batsman. Holding misses it and the ball hits his pads. Amarnath and the whole team appeal for the dismissal and Holding is given out leading to India winning the World Cup. The squad rushes towards the dressing room and the jubilant crowd rushes over on the ground and celebrations begin all over the country. A young Sachin Tendulkar back in Mumbai makes a promise that he would play for the Indian cricket team. Amarnath is named Player of the Match and Dev lifts the trophy along with the Indian team.\n Pre sale records As the credits roll, the real Kapil Dev is shown sharing his experience of winning the World Cup along with a montage of vintage photographs of the team.\n India A film based on the 1983 Cricket World Cup and India's win at the tournament was announced on mid-July 2016, with the rights for the production being purchased by Phantom Films \u2014 a joint production company owned by Madhu Mantena, featuring the collaborations of directors Anurag Kashyap, Vikas Bahl and Vikramaditya Motwane. Vishnu Vardhan Induri, the founder and managing director of Celebrity Cricket League, also expressed his interest in co-producing the film, citing his passion for cricket. It is touted to be the first venture of his newly formed production house, Vibri Media. The squad members of the 1983 team, along with former Indian cricketer Kapil Dev met the producers at a suburban hotel in Mumbai, discussing about the film. In the process, the two production companies had signed a Memorandum of understanding  with the 1983 team to make an official biopic, where according to the norms, the producers will get to use the actual names of the players as well as use real incidents from their lives. In an official statement regarding the biopic, Dev stated that \"the journey of the 1983 team is a story of inspiration which proves that one can achieve anything if they aim for it and work for it no matter what the world thinks\".\n Other territories \nDespite the official announcement, the makers were yet to finalise the cast and crew members and the director of the project. Rumours surfaced that Kabir Khan will direct the project and either Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor or Sushant Singh Rajput will play the role of Kapil Dev. When Khan was asked about his role in the biopic, he stated that \"he was fascinated on the story of India's journey at the 1983 Cricket World Cup\" but remained silent on the claims of directing the film. Akshay Kumar was also rumoured to act in the film, which was later declined. On 25 September 2017, Phantom Films announced that Singh would play the role of Kapil Dev, and Kabir Khan too confirmed that he will direct the film. Commercial analysis As a young schoolboy when I watched India win the 1983 Cricket World Cup. I had no idea that from that day onwards cricket in India will change forever. As a filmmaker, for me, the journey to that win, filled with raw energy and sheer passion of that young Indian team, is probably one of the most exciting stories I have worked on. Notes A launch event was hosted at JW Marriott Mumbai on 27 September 2017 by Reliance Entertainment and Vibri Media to announce the biopic officially under the title 83. Singh and the entire former team that won the Cricket World Cup in 1983 were present at the event. Speaking at the event, Khan said that the makers will begin pre-production and location scouting by late-November 2017, and has planned to shoot the film in real locations, in order to create authenticity and also \"to give youngsters to celebrate the milestone in the history of Indian Cricket which happened when many were not even born\".\n References This film was considered to be one of the last productions of Phantom Films, the other being Super 30  and Ghoomketu . The company dissolved in October 2018 after its response to a sexual assault allegation on Bahl by a former women employee of the company, and its collaborators later moved to work on independent projects. Bahl was ousted from the project. In May 2019, Sajid Nadiadwala joined the film as one of the co-producers.\n External links"

    "plot": "\n Plot \n Cast Swades: We, the People  is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language drama film co-written, directed and produced by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Gayatri Joshi and Kishori Ballal while Daya Shankar Pandey, Rajesh Vivek, Lekh Tandon appear in supporting roles.\n Production The plot was based on two episodes of the series Vaapsi on Zee TV's Yule Love Stories  which had Gowariker playing the role of Mohan Bhargav. The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydroelectric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the 2003 Kannada film Chigurida Kanasu which was based on the novel of the same name by Jnanapith awardee K. Shivaram Karanth and Bapu Kuti by Rajni Bakshi. The music and background score was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar. \n Inspiration Swades was theatrically released on 17 December 2004, and it opened to rave reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Khan, Joshi and Ballal, and the story, screenplay, and soundtrack. However, it emerged as a commercial failure at the box office.\n Themes At the 50th Filmfare Awards, Swades received 8 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director  and Best Music Director , and won Best Actor  and Best Background Score .\n Casting and filming It was dubbed in Tamil as Desam and released on 26 January 2005, coinciding with Indian Republic Day. Despite its commercial failure, Swades is regarded ahead of its time and is now considered a cult classic of Hindi cinema and one of the best films in Shah Rukh Khan's filmography. Shahrukh's performance in this film is regarded as among the best performances of his career. The film is owned by Red Chillies Entertainment.\n Reception Mohan Bhargava is a non-resident Indian who works as a Project Manager on the Global Precipitation Measurement  program at NASA in the United States. Mohan came to U. S. for college studies and kept on living there after his parents in India died in a car accident. He keeps worrying about Kaveri Amma, a nanny at his home in Uttar Pradesh who looked after him during his childhood days. After his parents' death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in Delhi and eventually lost contact with Mohan. Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S. Due to the recent success of Phase I of his project, he takes a few weeks off and travels to India. He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a year ago. Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh.\n Critical reception Mohan decides to rent a recreational vehicle to reach the village fearing that he might not get the required facilities there. Upon reaching Charanpur, he meets Kaveri Amma and learns how his childhood friend Geeta  brought Kaveri Amma to stay with her after Mohan's parents died. Geeta runs a school in Charanpur and works hard to improve the living conditions of the villagers through education. However, the village is divided largely by caste and religious beliefs. Geeta does not like Mohan's arrival as she thinks that he will take Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S., leaving her and her younger brother Nandan \"Chiku\" alone. Kaveri Amma tells Mohan that she needs to get Geeta married first and that it is her responsibility. Geeta believes in women empowerment and gender equality. This attracts Mohan towards Geeta and he too tries to help her by campaigning for education among backward communities and also girls. Mohan befriends villagers Nivaaran and Melaram, and they support him in his campaign. Mohan also wins the attention of Dadaji, a kind village chief.\n Box office Slowly love blossoms between Mohan and Geeta. Kaveri Amma asks Mohan to visit a nearby village named Kodi, and collect money from a man named Haridas who owes it to Geeta. Mohan visits Kodi and feels pity seeing Haridas' poor condition, which is such that he is unable to provide his family with meals every day. Haridas tells Mohan that since his caste profession of a weaver wasn't earning him any money, he shifted to tenant farming. But this change in profession led to his ostracization from the village and the villagers even denied him water for his crops. Mohan understands the pathetic situation and realises that many villages in India are still like Kodi. He returns to Charanpur with a heavy heart and decides to do something for the welfare of the village.\n Soundtrack Mohan extends his leave by three more weeks. He learns that electricity inconsistency and frequent power cuts are a big problem in Charanpur. He decides to set up a small hydroelectric power generation facility from a nearby water source. Mohan purchases all the equipment needed from his own funds and oversees the building of the power generation unit. The unit works and the village gets sufficient, consistent power from it.\n Tamil version Dadaji's health deteriorates and he passes away. Mohan is repeatedly called by NASA officials as the GPM project he was working on is reaching important stages and he has to return to the U. S. soon. Kaveri Amma tells him that she prefers to stay in Charanpur as it will be difficult for her to adapt to a new country at her age. Geeta also tells him that she will not settle down in another country and she would prefer it if Mohan stay in India with her and Kaveri Amma. Mohan returns to the U. S. with a heavy heart to complete the project. However, in the U. S., he has flashbacks of his time in India and wishes to return. After the successful completion of his project, he leaves U. S. and returns to India with intentions of working at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, from where he can also work with NASA. The film ends by showing Mohan staying in the village and wrestling with his friend Nivaaran near a temple.\n Awards Swades is inspired by the story of Aravinda Pillalamarri and Ravi Kuchimanchi, the non-resident Indian couple who returned to India and developed a pedal power generator to light remote, off-the-grid village schools. Gowariker spent considerable time with Pillalamarri and Kuchimanchi, both dedicated Association for India's Development  volunteers. He supposedly visited Bilgaon, an Adivasi village in the Narmada valley, which is the backdrop of the Narmada Bachao Andolan  movement. The people of Bilgaon are credited with doing 200 person-days of shramdaan  to make their village energy self-sufficient. The Bilgaon project is recognised as a model for replication by the Government of Maharashtra.\n Legacy The film was reported to be inspired by two episodes of the series titled Vaapsi on Zee TV's Yule Love Stories . The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydro electric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the Kannada novel Chigurida Kanasu by K. Shivaram Karanth and Bapu Kuti by Rajni Bakshi.\n See also Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson, Tushar Gandhi, noted the theme of Gandhism in the film. The name of the main character portrayed by Shah Rukh Khan is Mohan, which was Gandhi's birth name . The film opens with the quotation:\n Notes Hesitating to act because the whole vision might not be achieved, or because others do not yet share it, is an attitude that only hinders progress. External links Gowariker tries to address the lack of scientific temperament and widespread ignorance among the rural folks through the energetic number \"Ye Tara Wo Tara\", where Mohan is seen encouraging the children to experience the fascinating world of stars through his telescope. In a symbolic manner, the song rejects the defunct divisions of caste and class and at the same time, through its protagonist, tries to instill in the audience an appreciation of curiosity and observation.\n Reviews"

With Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he chose to pair up the same lead actors, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for his own romance film. During the filming of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Khan had also encouraged Johar to make his own film, and said that he would be willing to star in it. They were signed by producer and his father Yash Johar in early 1997. Yash Johar officially announced the film in October 1997 at Mehboob Studios in Bandra.\n Reception Johar first wrote a story, which was a love triangle between a tomboy, a very pretty girl, and a slightly insensitive boy, but he shelved the idea because he was not very satisfied with it. Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually, he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: \"It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father's life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That's how the story got made.\" The story also includes a \"personal desires vs. parental loyalties\" theme and has some \"East meets West\" themes, but instead of the characters going abroad, it creates a virtual West inside India.\n Critical reception Karan Johar was certain from the beginning that he wanted to cast Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, having observed him during the making of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It took longer to fill the role of Tina. The role was written with Twinkle Khanna in mind, but she turned it down. Other actresses such as Urmila Matondkar, Tabu, Shilpa Shetty, Aishwarya Rai, Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor were offered the role but also turned it down. Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan noticed Rani Mukerji's acting in Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat , and suggested her to Karan Johar. He thus signed her, giving a boost to her career. Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachur Singh were initially offered the role of Aman, but they both turned it down, thus prompting Johar to rope in Salman Khan.\n Box office Johar, who is also a costume designer, wanted to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema with this film. He and his friend Manish Malhotra, the film's costume designer, made trips to London for costumes, much to the chagrin of his father and producer Yash Johar, who was concerned about the budget. Many of the costumes in the film prominently displayed logos from designers such as DKNY and Polo. In addition to the designer fashions, Johar also created a somewhat fantastical world where the students speak Hinglish and enjoy a pristine college campus, where there is no crime or hate, and traditional Hindu values are pervasive. Johar admitted that the look and feel of the college scenes in the film were patterned after Beverly Hills 90210, saying, \"The art, the costumes, tilt toward the West, but the soul of the film is Indian.\" He hired Sharmishta Roy as art director, and told her to produce something similar to Riverdale High School of the Archie Comics, with some 90210 influence as well. Johar said of the outcome, \"If you see KKHH, Shahrukh plays Archie, Rani Mukherji plays Veronica, and Kajol played Betty. It was exactly that. And the principal looked like Weatherbee, and Ms. Grundy was Archana Puran Singh.\" Johar also hired Farah Khan to do the choreography, Jatin\u2013Lalit to provide the music, Santosh Thundiyil as cinematographer, and Nikhil Advani as his associate director. Shabina Khan assisted Manish Malhotra with costume design.\n India Filming began on 21 August 1997. The crew was young and inexperienced to the point where Shah Rukh Khan had to explain basic technicalities of filming. Khan later said, \"Karan makes no bones of the fact that his technical knowledge of filmmaking was not at its peak when he made the biggest hit of the decade.\" The entire film was shot in nine and half months with a substantial part of it shot in Mauritius. The title song was filmed over a ten-day period. in several picturesque locations in Scotland, including Eilean Donan, Glen Coe, Loch Lomond and Tantallon Castle with the nearby Bass Rock as a backdrop in one scene. The scenes from the summer camp in Shimla were filmed at Wenlock Downs in Ooty, Tamil Nadu.\n Overseas During the bicycle sequence in the song \"Yeh Ladka Hai Deewana\", Kajol lost control of her bike, fell flat on her face, and was knocked unconscious while also injuring her knee. During the promotional Making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai TV special, Kajol stated that the accident was her most memorable part of shooting the film because she doesn't remember it. During preparation for the reunion scene where the two leads met after more than 8 years apart, the director told them to improvise and rehearse the reactions that they might use, but he secretly taped them and was so happy with the result that it was put into the film.\n Accolades The soundtrack for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was composed by Jatin\u2013Lalit and the lyrics were penned by Sameer. This is the first collaboration of the duo with Karan Johar. It was released by the Sony Music label on 12 August 1998. While the film was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and recorded one song. However, when the movie was titled Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it decent and could see that the title has become quite a buzzword, realizing that he was the only one who disliked the title.\n Home media The album became the best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, with 8 million units sold in India. The title song remained on the Indian music charts for over a year, and the album peaked at number #2 on the Malaysian albums chart  in 1999. Sony Music Indonesia also sold 300,000 copies in Indonesia, for a combined 8.3 million copies sold in India and Indonesia.\n Legacy Mukul Deshpande of Planet Bollywood rated the soundtrack 8.5 out of 10 stars, although he did not like all of the songs. In 2012, it was voted as the most popular film song of the previous decade by NDTV.  The full soundtrack came in second place in a similar poll conducted by the BBC, the first place being taken by Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, an album which was also composed by Jatin\u2013Lalit.\n See also On 2002, Sony Music India also released Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in Telugu version.\n References While comparing the film to Dil To Pagal Hai , Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave Kuch Kuch Hota Hai 3.5 out of 5 stars. She especially liked the performance of Kajol, and thought that the film would appeal to young and romantic viewers primarily for its \"MTV ambience\" and \"Valentine's Day flavours\". On the negative side, she said \"The second half, however, gets drowned in a sea of emotions. Too many people begin to cry a bit too much.\" Anish Khanna of Planet Bollywood rated the film 9.5 out of 10 stars, calling it \"pure escapist cinema at its best.\" He praised the cinematography, choreography, set decoration, and also raved over Kajol's performance, along with her onscreen chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan. Overall, he said, \"Karan Johar makes an impressive directorial debut, has a good script sense, and knows how to make a film with S-T-Y-L-E.\" In contrast to these views, the reaction of Sujata C J, writing for Rediff.com, was that the film was very disappointing, with many cliches and a bad storyline, though Santosh Thundiyil and Sharmishta Roy were praised for their camerawork and art direction, respectively. Nandita Chowdhury in a review for India Today, said that Karan Johar was almost able to rekindle the Khan-Kajol magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, and that overall the film was \"a good distraction\".\n External links"

    "plot": "\n Plot Guru is a 2007 Indian Hindi-language  drama film directed and co-written by Mani Ratnam. It stars Mithun Chakraborty, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Madhavan, Vidya Balan and Roshan Seth. The score and soundtrack for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman. Incidentally, Mithun Chakraborty also previously acted in a 1989 film of the same name in Hindi, as well as a 2003 film of the same name in Bengali.\n Cast The film was rumored to be a biopic of the industrial tycoon Dhirubhai Ambani, but Ratnam refuted the claims, clarifying it was a work of fiction. The film was released on 12 January 2007 with its premi\u00e8re at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto, Canada, on Thursday, 11 January 2007 by Roger Nair, making it the first Indian film to have a mainstream international premi\u00e8re in Canada. Roger Nair productions acquired the rights for Canada and held a premiere with most of the cast and crew flown to Toronto, Canada. The film was premiered in the Tous Les Cinemas du Monde  section of 2007 Cannes Film Festival. The film had also been dubbed and released in Tamil with the same title while in Telugu with the title Gurukanth.\n Production The beginning of the film is set in 1951 in a small village of Idar in Sabarkantha district, northern Gujarat, where a young man named Gurukant Desai dreams of making it big someday. His father Kantilal, the headmaster of the village school, tells him not to dream and that dreams never come true. Guru decides to go to Turkey and enter the spice trade, followed by a blue-collar job with Burmah Shell; later, he is promoted but refuses the job, as he wants to work for himself. Guru returns to his village, he marries Sujata, mainly because of the dowry she brings him. Along with Sujata and her brother Jignesh, Guru migrates to Bombay and starts trading in cloth. Gradually, he expands his business and sets up manufacturing units of his own, under the name \"Shakti Corporation\".\n Reception \"Nanaji\" Manik Dasgupta, who publishes a newspaper \"Swatantra\" , treats Guru as his son. Guru likewise looks upon him as a father figure who supported him during his early days of struggle in Bombay. He also develops a strong friendship with Meenu, granddaughter of Nanaji. Meenu develops multiple sclerosis as she grows up, and begins using a wheelchair.\n Box office As Guru's business grows into one of the largest in India, he ruthlessly pursues success. He smuggles machine parts for his polyester mills, illegally creates goods, and manipulates stocks to make a higher profit. But when Nanaji learns that Guru's means of success are not always honest, he, along with a reporter of his newspaper, Shyam Saxena, decides to expose Guru's increasingly corrupt ways.\n Critical reception The stress of his battle with the newspaper causes Guru to have a stroke, and he is paralysed on his right side. Meanwhile, Meenu, who is now married to Shyam, is slowly weakening from her illness, and eventually dies. In the end, Guru is brought before a private government inquiry on 16 October 1980 to defend himself against the charges pressed against him, but tells the press in next day that he was an ordinary villager who didn't even understand the meaning of excise duty, customs, sales tax. All he knew was his business. But the corrupt system made sure that a villager doesn't become a rich businessman. As a result, he had to indulge in corrupt practices. This forces the government to clear him of 27 of the 29 charges against him. He is charged with a fine of \u20b96.3 million  and \u20b996,000  for the respective two charges, which are proved and is allowed to return to his company. The movie ends with Guru telling Shakti's shareholders that his father was proven wrong as he said dreams don't turn true, but they all are now a part of India's largest company. Guru asks them if they should stop. Shareholders refuse and resolve to be the largest company in the world instead.\n Accolades Guru was written and directed by Mani Ratnam, while Vijay Krishna Acharya wrote the Hindi dialogues. Filming took place in Mumbai, Turkey, Badami and Melkote , as well as in Chennai, Pollachi, Chettinad region Tamil Nadu, and Athirappilly in Kerala. Much of the film was shot on the Express Estates, the former home of The Indian Express and Dinamani. The music is composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Gulzar. Cinematography for the film is handled by Rajiv Menon. Several scenes were deleted from the final theatrical version, including a scene in which Sujata first gives birth to a stillborn child and a scene in which Guru becomes angry with his wife for visiting Manik Dasgupta.\n Soundtrack Guru has others involved in the production as a film that is reflective of a man's desire for ambition and success, and how times have changed from the period immediately after the country's independence to the present. Some reports have speculated that this film is a biographical film of, one of India's biggest industrial tycoons, Dhirubhai Ambani. Like Guru, Ambani also had roots in Gujarat as the son of a schoolteacher, went abroad to work for the gas company Shell, and returned to India to import polyester. Ratnam has described Guru as inspired by stories both past and present.\n See also The less known fact is that, the role of Madhavan is based on Swaminathan Gurumurthy, who along with Ramnath Goenka worked to expose Reliance Industries. The title is speculated to be an acknowledgement of this fact, where in his name is playfully swapped with Ambani's character. In real life, Gurumurthy has twin daughters much like the Guru character in the movie.\n References Guru opened well upon release, gaining momentum over time. In the United States, Guru, opening on a limited release, registered good collections in its opening weekend, fetching \u20b93 crore during this period, with a high screen average. By its seventh week, the film had netted \u20b941.65 crore in India, collecting \u20b913 crore in the US and the UK. As of 23 February 2007, Guru, having released 12 January, has grossed more than \u20b983.67 crore across the world and was declared a \"hit\" at the box office. In the United States, it was a blockbuster.\n External links"
