When she smiles, it's perfectly located between a sweet display of affection and a snarling warning.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it a half star, stating that \"The Roommate\u00a0\u2013 the umpteenth uncredited remake of 1992's Single White Female\u00a0\u2013 sucks bad, real bad\" and that \"Danish director Christian E. Christiansen has no flair for suspense\". Meester's performance garnered praise from other top critics, including the Los Angeles Times, which states: \"Here, her performance often has the feeling of a sports car in neutral. When she punches it for quick changes of tone from manic to wounded or around the bend, she shows how much more she is capable of.\"\n References Opening in 2,534 theaters, the film grossed $15.6 million its opening weekend to take first place at the box office.

The film is set in a large, tower-style \"Vertical Self-Management Center.\" Its residents, who are switched every month between its many floors, are fed via a platform which, initially filled with food at the top floor, gradually descends through the tower's levels, stopping for a fixed amount of time on each. The system inevitably leads to conflict, as the residents at the top levels get to eat as much as they can, with each level getting only the leftovers from the previous ones.\n Cast The film's cast includes Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9, Antonia San Juan, Zorion Eguileor, Emilio Buale Coka and Alexandra Masangkay.

People on lower levels can eat only what those above leave and are subjected to fatal temperatures if they keep the food. Prisoners are randomly reassigned to a new level each month. Trimagasi reveals that when assigned to level 132, he and his former cellmate cannibalized a resident who had fallen down the shaft. One day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, whom Trimagasi explains descends the pit every month searching for her child.\n Release Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the facility in exchange for a diploma, while Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the first month, they become friends, but on the day of the room shuffle, they are reassigned to level 171.

The next morning, Imoguiri is distraught to find that Miharu has killed and eaten her dog. As Miharu leaves, Goreng mentions Miharu's child to Imoguiri, who despondently informs him that there are no children in the tower and Miharu registered alone.

Goreng eats her flesh to survive, plagued with hallucinations of his former cellmates.\n Accolades In the fifth month, Goreng is assigned to level 6. His new cellmate, Baharat, attempts unsuccessfully to escape. Estimating that there are 250 levels, Goreng convinces Baharat to ride the platform down with him and ration the food. Fellow prisoner Sr. Brambang convinces them to send a symbolic message to the Administration by leaving a single panna cotta untouched. As they descend further, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. They eventually encounter Miharu being attacked and try to save her, but she is killed and they are left severely injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually reaching level 333, where Goreng notices a child - Miharu's daughter - hiding under the bed. He gets off the platform with Baharat, only to have it continue downward, leaving them behind. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed the girl the untouched panna cotta.\n See also Goreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" He awakens to find that Baharat has bled to death from his injuries. Goreng takes the child with him when the platform arrives. They descend to the bottom of the pit, where he once again hallucinates Trimagasi. Goreng attempts to back on the platform, explaining to Trimagasi that he must bear the message. Trimagasi replies that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Realizing Trimagasi is right, Goreng gets off the platform and the two walk away, watching as Miharu's daughter ascends.\n References The film was produced by Basque Films alongside Mr. Miyagi Films and Plataforma la pel\u00edcula AIE, with the participation of RTVE and ETB and support from ICAA, the Basque administration and ICO.

A few months later, Arjun and Naina are contacted by the blackmailer, leading to the present events.\n Soundtrack Badal decides that Rani must have killed Arjun and could have easily done so since Sunny's father, Nirmal, works at the hotel. Naina reveals that she saw Rani in the room but lied to check whether Badal was a good lawyer or not, to which Badal reveals there was no witness and he was lying to get the truth from Naina. However, Naina who now trusts Badal, reveals a secret: Sunny was still alive in the trunk before she disposed of the car. However, she let him drown, deciding not to save him to protect herself from potential incrimination. Surprised by her murderous and selfish actions, Badal proposes an alternate sequence of events in which Naina was the one who actually pressured Arjun into hiding the crime and framed Sunny. In this version, Arjun grew so guilty that he traveled to the hotel to confess the truth to Rani and Nirmal, prompting Naina to kill him. With the police knocking, she decided to injure herself and frame Rani for the crime. Naina denies this and claims that what Badal proposed earlier is the truth.\n Reception Badal refuses to fight Naina's case. When she implores him for help, he agrees only if she honestly tells him whether she killed Arjun. Naina confesses to Arjun's murder, revealing where Sunny's body is. Badal agrees to continue defending her and excuses himself for a moment, going out to get some fresh air while Naina receives a call from Jimmy. She realises that Badal's pen is interfering with the call. Naina then discovers that the person who came to her as Badal Gupta was an imposter when she finds the real Badal Gupta at the doorstep. Naina, shocked, takes apart Badal's pen to reveal a voice recorder inside that recorded every word of their meeting, including her confessions of both murders. As she glances outside her window, Naina makes eye contact with the imposter and Rani in the apartment building across from hers. \"Badal\" takes off his disguise, revealing himself to be Nirmal. Rani calls the police for Naina's arrest.\n Critical response The principal photography of the film began on 14 June 2018 in Glasgow, Scotland.\n Box office On 11 February 2019, Shah Rukh Khan, whose production house Red Chillies Entertainment is producing the film, tweeted two first look posters of the film, one with Bachchan's character and another with Pannu's.

The ensemble cast includes Carter Jenkins, Lawrence Kao, Allegra Masters, Michael Nardelli, Julie Benz, Mercy Malick, Lisa Pelikan, and Cesar Garcia. It was inspired by the 1957 drama 12 Angry Men and was shot in 2014. It premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 28, 2015, before being released to video-on-demand on October 16. In the film, fifty people wake up in a darkened room, only to find that one of them is killed every two minutes or when they attempt to leave. When they realize that they can control which person is selected to die, blocs emerge based on personal values.\n Plot Fifty people awaken in a darkened room, arranged in two concentric circles around a black dome.  When they attempt to move from their designated platforms or touch the others, alarms sound off.  When someone ignores the warning and leaves formation, a beam from the dome kills them, and their body is quickly removed.  As the others panic, a man attempts to calm them, but the device kills him mid-sentence.  Thereafter, every two minutes, another person is killed.  After several people die, the group realizes that the room's technology allows them to use hand gestures to vote for who dies, while arrows on the floor show each person their own vote but not others'.  They attempt to boycott the vote, but someone is randomly selected to die after two minutes.\n Cast Following someone's suggestion, the group buys time to think by deciding in advance to eliminate the elderly for the next selections.  The captives discuss where they are, how they got there, who has abducted them, and why.  A young man, Eric, remembers attempting to flee Los Angeles, and others concur.  Eric says that he was pulled into the air, later waking in a red room with other humans.  The old man next in line agrees, saying he saw and heard aliens.  The disbelieving group eliminates him instead of listening.\n Production After another member of the group aggressively targets a 52-year-old cancer survivor over the objections of people who do not consider her elderly, he is eliminated.  Several people say they recognize the others: a man identifies the woman next to him as his wife, another man identifies the doctor he was having an affair with, and a tattooed man is eliminated after he admits to a cop's accusation of domestic violence.  After several minorities are quickly eliminated, an African-American man claims the process has become racist.  Several others dispute this, but when the cop goes on a racist rant, he is selected next.\n Release The captives experiment with voting, find they cannot vote for themselves, and attempt to give one vote to every person in the circle. One man gives a second vote for a pregnant woman, so Eric votes for him; this causes a tie and the man is killed in a run-off vote.  After several take their own lives by leaving formation to buy the others time, an atheist antagonizes the theists who praised the volunteers' faith.  The atheist is briefly saved, but when he mocks the girl beside him for having her boss pay for her breast enlargement, he is killed.  A homophobic lawyer targets a lesbian, and he is killed as a result.  The group realizes that one of the final two people left must not vote  to render a winner.\n Critical reception The group creates a schism. One bloc  believes that everyone should sacrifice themselves to save a pregnant woman and a little girl, while the other bloc  wants to eliminate them immediately as a threat to their survival, as they believe everyone is equal and no special privileges should be afforded. The husband and wife team initially vote with the bearded man's bloc but the husband is forced to vote with Eric's bloc when they threaten to eliminate his wife. Under interrogation, the couple admit that they concocted the relationship to curry favor, resulting in the \"husband's\" elimination.\n References Eric's faction incurs heavy losses but eliminates the other faction, leaving only Eric, the pregnant woman, the girl, and a silent man who has never voted.  Eric theorizes that aliens have used the process to learn about humanity's values.  After the silent man is eliminated, Eric manipulates the girl to simultaneously sacrifice themselves.  As the girl dies, Eric instead votes to kill the pregnant woman, leaving him and the woman's unborn child.  Eric votes to kill the child, becoming lone survivor. He awakes in Los Angeles where he joins a group of people, primarily children and pregnant women, watching a fleet of alien craft float over the city.\n External links"

The DVD contains CCTV footage of Armaan and his friends leaving a hotel with Rosie. Rosie confides in Surjan that three years ago, she was picked up by Armaan and his friends, Sanjay and Nikhil.

Surjan reconciles with Roshni. In a post-credits scene, two workers put a \"Caution\" sign on the same accident spot.\n Controversy Following the release of her first film, Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. , Kagti was approached and offered to direct many films by several production houses. However, unable to find any films that interested her, she began working on a new script with her friend Zoya Akhtar in early 2010. Speaking about it, she said, \"Zoya and I thought of the story and co-wrote it. We do a lot of writing together. We are also best-friends so it is fun and there is a huge comfort factor.\" Initially, Shahrukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Salman Khan were reportedly approached to play the male lead but opted out due to differing reasons. Upon finalising the story, she approached Aamir Khan with the script in November 2010 and he agreed to produce and star in it. Since the start of pre-production, the project has faced several speculations regarding its title. In November 2011, Khan confirmed that the film was titled Talaash: The Answer Lies Within.\n Critical Reception In an interview with The Indian Express, Kagti revealed that a few months before casting Khan in the film, she had approached him with another project. Later, Kareena Kapoor and Rani Mukerji were signed on to star opposite Khan. Prior to the start of principal photography, the actors attended acting workshops and signed a non-disclosure agreement. To prepare for a key scene in the film, Khan and Mukerji took swimming lessons.\n India The principal photography for the film started in March 2011 with Khan and Mukerji in Mumbai. For a scene involving Khan and Kapoor, it was reported that both the actors would shoot in a red-light district. However, Kagti dismissed it and explained that it wouldn't be safe to do so. The scene was later shot at the Leopold Cafe on Colaba Causeway. The film's second phase continued with the entire cast in Pondicherry and was completed by the end of August. The final phase was expected to commence the following month in Khopoli with an underwater shot.\n Overseas Khan, who never knew how to swim went under rigorous training for this underwater sequence. He was trained for 3 months under a specialist trainer and went well prepared for the shoot. Due to visibility problems, it was cancelled and later filmed at an undisclosed water studio in London. The filming was completed by November 2011 after some of the remaining shots were executed at the Bandstand Promenade.\n Box office \nThe soundtrack is composed by Ram Sampath and Javed Akhtar penned the lyrics for all the songs. The music was launched on 19 October 2012 by T-Series. The album features vocals by Ram Sampath, Vishal Dadlani, Suman Sridhar, Sona Mohapatra, Ravindra Upadhyay and Rupesh. The song \"Jee Le Zara\" has a remix version. India The album met with highly positive reviews from music critics. Indiaglitz quoted, \"Once again, Ram Sampath has an unmatched compilation of tracks here. Along with random fantastic lyrics they have created a masterpiece here.\" Bollyspice reviewed the album stating, \"The soundtrack to Talaash: The Answer Lies Within is like a box of chocolates: it contains a little 'good' and a little 'not-so-good' in it. Yet it is still an album that is worth listening!\". Rediff reviewed, \"Except a steady undercurrent of anxiety, the soundtrack of Talaash: The Answer Lies Within doesn't have a fixed theme or ambiance. Every song belongs to a unique genre and fosters the enigma of Kagti's suspense drama. And that's what makes Sampath's efforts truly appreciable.\" Planet Bollywood said, \"A film made by Aamir Khan Productions doesn\u2019t need an item song or song for the masses to make it successful. Instead, the music is made solely for the film in mind. If the listener can appreciate it before the release of the film then that is a bonus but that\u2019s not essential.\" Sify quoted, \"Overall, the soundtrack is not out-of-the-box, but the overdose of electronic music doesn't bother either. Thus, it's an album which may not top the charts, but some songs could definitely make their way into many people's personal playlists.\" Gomolo stated, \"Ram Sampath is continuously giving very fresh and stunning music for Khan. The album is full of fresh, scrumptious and susceptible tracks.\" Musicperk summarized the album as \"Well, the answer lies within!\", the tagline of the film itself.\n Overseas Talaash: The Answer Lies Within tied up with Windows 8 for its marketing.

One evening, they find their house broken into, although the only items stolen are a laptop and their cell phones. A few days later, Meera is woken up by a rattling noise and finds the power out.

    "plot": "Along Came a Spider is a 2001 American neo-noir psychological thriller film directed by Lee Tamahori. It is the second installment in the Alex Cross film series and a sequel to the 1997 film Kiss the Girls, with Morgan Freeman and Jay O. Sanders reprising their roles as detective Alex Cross and FBI-agent Kyle Craig. The screenplay by Marc Moss was adapted from the 1993 novel of the same title by James Patterson, but many of the key plot elements of the book were eliminated. The film was a box office success, although receiving mixed reviews from critics.\n Plot After Washington, D.C. detective, forensic psychologist and author Alex Cross loses control of a sting operation, resulting in the death of his partner, he retires from the force. He is drawn back to police work when Megan Rose, the daughter of a United States senator, is kidnapped from her exclusive private school by Gary Soneji, a computer science teacher. US Secret Service Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan, held responsible for the breach in security, joins forces with Cross to find the missing girl.\n Cast Soneji contacts Cross by phone and alerts him to the fact one of Megan's sneakers is in the detective's mailbox, proving that Soneji is the kidnapper. Cross deduces that the man is obsessed with the 1932 Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. kidnapping and hopes to become as infamous as Bruno Hauptmann by committing a new \"Crime of the Century\", which might be explored by Cross in one of his true crime books. \n Production Megan's kidnapping proves to be only part of Soneji's real plan: to kidnap Dimitri Starodubov, the son of the Russian president, and guarantee greater infamy for himself.\n Writing After Cross and Flannigan foil his second kidnapping plot, a supposed call from the kidnapper demands that Cross deliver a ransom of $10 million in diamonds. He must follow an intricate maze of calls made to public phone booths scattered throughout the city. Following the ransom directions, Cross ultimately tosses the gems out the window of a rapidly moving Metro train to a figure standing by the tracks. \n Reception Soneji later arrives at Flannigan's home and confronts Cross after disabling Flannigan with a taser. As Soneji has not reacted to Cross's verbal comment about receiving the ransom amount , the detective realizes that the kidnapper is unaware of the ransom demand and delivery. Soneji tries to leave with Flannigan, but Cross kills him.\n Box office Cross becomes suspicious and realizes that someone else discovered Soneji long before his plot came to fruition. After searching Flannigan's personal computer, he finds enough evidence to prove that Flannigan and her fellow Secret Service agent Ben Devine used Soneji as a pawn in their own plot to collect a ransom for Megan. \n Critical response Cross tracks them down to a secluded farmhouse, where Flannigan has murdered Devine and is now intent on killing Megan. He stops her by shooting her in the heart. Cross then takes Megan to her parents.\n Accolades One of the primary elements of the book screenwriter Marc Moss eliminated from his script was the fact that Soneji is actually a mild-mannered suburban husband and father suffering from dissociative identity disorder resulting from having been abused as a child. After a lengthy trial for kidnapping and several murders not included in the film, he is found guilty but remanded to a mental institution to serve his sentence. Also missing from the film is a romantic relationship shared by Cross and Jezzie, her trial and eventual execution by lethal injection, and the discovery of Megan , hidden away with a native Bolivian family near the Andes Mountains, two years after her kidnapping.\n Series reboot A few other minor differences from the original book include: Dimitri  being kidnapped at the same time as Megan ; Megan's  mother was the more famous of her parents, being a popular actress; when the children are kidnapped they are sprayed with chloroform spray.\n See also Box office receipts totaled US$105,178,561, of which $74,078,174 was from the United States having earned US$16,712,407 in its opening weekend at 2,530 theaters.\n References On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 32% based on reviews from 126 critics. The site's critics consensus was: \"Derivative and contains too many implausible situations\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 42% based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n External links"

    "plot": "Gothika is a 2003 American supernatural psychological horror thriller film directed by Mathieu Kassovitz, written by Sebastian Gutierrez, co-produced by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, and starring Halle Berry with Robert Downey Jr., Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Charles S. Dutton, John Carroll Lynch, and Bernard Hill. The film follows a psychiatrist who finds herself incarcerated in the penitentiary in which she works, accused of brutally murdering her own husband.\n Plot The fourth project developed by production company Dark Castle Entertainment, following 2002's Ghost Ship, Gothika was the second film by the company to be co-distributed by Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures, the first being Thirteen Ghosts. It was also the first feature by Dark Castle to boast a number of high-profile stars in it's lead roles.\n Cast Gothika was shot in Montreal, Quebec in the spring of 2003. It was released theatrically in the United States on November 21, 2003, the Friday before Thanksgiving. The film grossed $141.6 million internationally, though it received generally negative reviews from critics.\n Production Dr. Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist at Woodward Penitentiary in rural western Connecticut, crashes her car one night on a country road to avoid hitting a young woman. When she awakens, she finds herself an inmate of the women's ward in which she works, receiving treatment from her colleague, Dr. Pete Graham. Miranda is horrified when Pete reveals to her that her husband, Douglas, has been the victim of a brutal axe murder, and that she is the sole suspect. As Miranda attempts to adjust to life as an inmate, she is haunted by visions of the young woman she saw the night of the car accident, and is attacked by her apparition in the showers; the woman carves the phrase \"Not Alone\" into Miranda's arm, though the hospital staff presume Miranda is self-harming. She later learns that the same phrase was scrawled in Douglas's blood inside their home after his murder. Miranda meets with her lawyer and start preparing for her defense and they bring in Douglas's best friend, Sheriff Bob Ryan, who confronts Miranda in the penitentiary, accusing her of the murder.\n Soundtrack Miranda begins to bond with fellow inmate Chloe Sava, whom she treated prior to her incarceration. During Miranda's previous sessions with Chloe, Chloe claimed to have been raped in the hospital. One night, Miranda's cell door inexplicably opens, and she quietly prowls through the ward. As she passes Chloe's cell, she witnesses Chloe being raped, and glimpses a tattoo of an Anima Sola on the perpetrator's chest. She is subsequently found by guards, who disbelieve her story. As time passes, Miranda regains memories of the night of the car accident, and subsequently identifies the mysterious woman as Rachel, the daughter of Miranda's superior, Dr. Phil Parsons; she had died in an apparent suicide several years prior. Late one night, Miranda is attacked by Rachel's ghost in her cell, and subsequently manages to escape from the hospital. She returns to her home and observes the blood-stained crime scene. This triggers vivid memories of Miranda committing Douglas's murder, though she believes that Rachel possessed her to carry out the act.\n Release Recalling that Douglas mentioned he was going to visit his rural farmhouse in Rhode Island prior to his murder, Miranda decides to visit the site, hoping it will contain clues. While investigating a cellar in the barn, she finds a blood-stained mattress, along with containers of sedatives, restraints, and video recording equipment. Miranda views one of the tapes: It is a snuff film shot by Douglas, which shows him raping, torturing, and murdering a young woman. Police subsequently arrive at the property, arresting Miranda and finding one of Douglas's victims, Tracey Seaver, still alive in the barn. Miranda realizes that Rachel possessed her to avenge her own murder by Douglas.\n Critical response Incarcerated in the county jail, Miranda converses with Sheriff Ryan about Douglas's crimes, and asserts that Rachel's suicide was staged; she also espouses her belief that a second perpetrator was involved. Using her expertise as a psychiatrist, Miranda constructs a psychological profile of the second perpetrator, and realizes it is in fact Sheriff Ryan. Ryan, realizing Miranda has identified him, attempts to inject her with a sedative. In the struggle, Miranda tears at his shirt, revealing the Anima Sola tattoo on his chest. Miranda manages to turn the syringe on Ryan before fleeing. In a drugged state, Ryan pursues Miranda through the jail, ranting proudly about his and Douglas's crimes; he tells her that Rachel was their first victim, and that they worked together to abduct, rape, and murder a string of local women. Suddenly, Rachel's apparition appears, distracting Ryan. He begins to shoot at it, causing a gas leak and subsequent explosion that sets him ablaze. Miranda obtains his gun, and shoots the burned Ryan to death. Moments later Pete arrives at the jail to try to save her, having realized the truth.\n Home media Approximately a year later, Miranda, now freed, walks with Chloe, also released from the penitentiary, on a city sidewalk. Miranda claims to be free of Rachel's influence and sends Chloe off in a taxi. Miranda then sees a young boy standing in the middle of the road who appears as though he is about to be struck by a fire truck. Miranda yells for the boy to move, but after the fire truck passes through the boy without harming him, she realizes he was only a ghost. As Miranda walks away, she fails to notice a missing person flyer for the young boy on a nearby telephone pole.\n Awards The fourth feature film produced by Dark Castle Entertainment, Gothika was the first to boast a high-profile leading cast, and was the company's largest-scale production at the time, with a budget of approximately $40 million.\n Won Berry was partly inspired to take the role because her mother, a nurse, worked in a psychiatric hospital for decades.\n Nominated Filming took place in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in the spring of 2003. Shooting of Berry's sequences was temporarily halted for several weeks in May 2003, after Robert Downey Jr., while filming a tense scene with Berry, grabbed and twisted her arm, accidentally breaking it.\n See also The score's original music was composed by John Ottman. \"Behind Blue Eyes\" by Limp Bizkit  was featured in the film but was not available on the soundtrack. The record was released on November 18, 2003, via Var\u00e8se Sarabande.\n References Gothika was released on November 21, 2003, in North America, grossing $19.3 million in the opening weekend and ranking at #2, behind The Cat in the Hat. It went on to gross $59.7 million in the US and $81.9 million from foreign markets for a worldwide total of $141.6 million.\n External links"

A year and a half later, however, they are stressed due to work and school and fight frequently in their apartment in Stockholm. The stress is compounded when Nadja learns that she is pregnant, which she is unhappy about as she is studying to be a doctor and she is not sure if she and David should be parents. She decides to keep it a secret from David. Nadja opens up to an older neighbor, Tomas , and he assures her that she and David will be great parents; he insists that parenthood is life's greatest gift and implies he has lost a child of his own. The next morning, David surprises Nadja with a camping trip to see the northern lights, and the two reconcile and take the trip with their dog, Boris. While stopping for gas, David encounters two locals, brothers Jarmo and Rolle, and is made uncomfortable by their rough mannerisms and their truck bed full of dead game. As he has difficulties taking his car out of park, he accidentally bumps into the brothers' truck, leaving scratches. David chooses to drive off instead of saying something, which annoys Nadja. When they reach their destination at an inn, the woman at the front desk treats them strangely and silently refuses to serve them, leaving her brother Einar to imply that she's not used to seeing an interracial couple. He learns of their itinerary and offers to host them at his cabin in the wilderness. Nadja becomes nervous seeing Jarmo and Rolle in the establishment, and when they leave, they discover that someone has keyed their car and vandalized their bumper sticker with a racial epithet. Angered by this, Nadja spots their pickup truck later on the drive and scratches it with a screwdriver, narrowly avoiding retaliation when the brothers catch her in the act. \n Production The couple camps beneath the northern lights, and Nadja reveals she is pregnant, which makes David nervous and unsure. Their conversation is interrupted when they spot a red dot on the wall of their tent. They first assume that it is a laser pointer prank, but quickly realize that is a laser sight from a rifle and guess that the brothers are attacking them in revenge for the car damage. Boris escapes into the wilderness while they try to hide, and they hear gunshots and the sound of Boris whining. After they are shot at, they flee into the forest and hear their pursuers chase after them. After spending the night hiding in a small shelter, they return to the bloodied campsite and find all their belongings missing, and Boris's decapitated head in the tent. While searching for any remaining possessions, David is injured when his arm gets caught in a hunting trap. Finding nothing to help them, they set off to find help. However, they are soon shot at again, and David, increasingly losing blood, hallucinates a boy in a winter coat staring at them. David is shot in the shoulder while Nadja escapes unhurt, and the two search for each other as a snowstorm sets in. Nadja realizes that she has run atop a frozen lake, and as David searches for her, he falls in and is narrowly rescued by her. The couple finally makes it to an emergency cabin, where they phone rescuers and are told they will have to wait until the storm passes for help.\n Development The next morning, they hear a vehicle approach the cabin and realize it is an armed  Jarmo, who works as a mountain rescuer. Escaping through a back window, they flee into the woods and seek shelter in what is revealed to be the den of a hibernating bear. Jarmo discovers them, but before he can shoot, Nadja shoots him with a flare found at the cabin. David's condition deteriorates as they progress, and he hallucinates the boy again and begins mumbling about guilt. Spotting Einar's cabin in the distance, Nadja runs ahead to get help for David, but encounters Rolle on the way. Rolle seems confused by her appearance, but before he can act, David knocks him unconscious with a rock, and the two make it to Einar's cabin. Einar appears to call for help, but Nadja realizes that he is contacting someone else, and Einar suddenly becomes aggressive and locks them in a room discovered to be covered in stealth photographs taken of the couple.\n Reception Finally, Tomas arrives with a rifle, and the truth is revealed: the day of the couple's engagement, Nadja attempted to perform oral sex on David as they drove home, and a distracted David struck and killed a pedestrian -- the boy he had hallucinated earlier, who was also Tomas's son and Einar's nephew. David chose to drive off instead of calling the police as Nadja wanted, which left her wracked with guilt. On that day, Tomas had been playing with a drone with his son, which had caused him to run into the road; however, the drone also captured the couple's license plate, and a grieving Tomas tracked them down and moved into a nearby apartment to surveil them. Tomas is intent on inflicting revenge on the couple for callously driving away and had been behind the earlier murder attempts. He now decides to become more sadistic and tries to get David to use a power drill to torture and kill Nadja's child, and he shoots David in the knee when he does not comply. Tomas prepares to kill them both but is interrupted by the arrival of a furious Jarmo, who has tracked down the couple. In the confusion, Tomas shoots and fatally wounds Jarmo, who accidentally does the same to Einar, and Nadja and David escape while Jarmo and Tomas struggle for a rifle.\n References Nadja and David attempt to flee, but David cannot escape with his injuries.

The film stars Parineeti Chopra, Avinash Tiwary, Aditi Rao Hydari and Kirti Kulhari and was released worldwide on 26 February 2021 on Netflix.\n Plot The film revolves around Mira Kapoor , an alcoholic and troubled divorcee who gets embroiled in a big murder investigation.\n Cast The film begins with Nusrat being chased by someone in the forest and Mira is standing at the station. In a flashback it is shown that Mira met her husband Shekhar at a wedding where they fell in love. They both get married and Mira is pregnant. Mira is fighting a case against Jimmy Bhagga where she successfully wins and Jimmy has to go to jail. A few days later she is hit by a car. Mira suffers from anterograde amnesia caused by a car accident. She is also an alcoholic, which doesn\u2019t exactly help the memory loss either. She and Shekhar have separated and Shekhar married someone else.\n Production Obsessed with a seemingly perfect couple she sees from the train window on her commute to London, one drunken night Mira follows the young woman into the forest but doesn\u2019t recall what happens next.\n Release Mira is actually a bit of a badass. The police have a decent amount of circumstantial evidence against her and even move to make an arrest but Mira escapes out the window and calls in a favour from the family member of a former client. Get me a phone, cash, and a gun, she says.\n Soundtrack Mira discovers that the missing girl Nusrat wasn\u2019t as happily married as she looked and that she was having an affair.  It\u2019s entirely plausible that Mira is the killer \u2013 in a drunken rage which she accidentally records on her phone, Mira fantasizes about smashing Nusrat\u2019s head in, angry that she is ruining her own marriage.\n Reception There are plenty of other suspects too, though, including Nusrat\u2019s sex pest dance teacher, a blackmailing private eye, and more than one aggressive and abusive husband.\n Accolades In the story, we learn that Mira\u2019s philandering ex-husband Shehkar has been gaslighting her for years. She\u2019s a blackout drunk but she isn\u2019t the violent, offensive brute that he\u2019s been claiming, and she isn\u2019t responsible for him losing his job. \nThough Nusrat was unhappy in her marriage to abusive Anand and was pregnant by someone else, Anand didn\u2019t kill her. Nor did the kindly therapist who was trying to help Nusrat. It turns out the Nusrat\u2019s baby was Shehkar\u2019s, and the night Mira followed Nusrat into \u201cGreenwich Forest\u201d Shehkar was there too and it was him who bashed Mira over the head with a rock and left her there. Nusrat told him of the pregnancy, they fought, and Shehkar strangled Nusrat, leaving her for dead.\n References But, she wasn\u2019t dead, and here\u2019s where the film diverts. It turns out there were two other people in Greenwich Forest that night. These are the police woman in charge of the case, Inspector Dalbir, and a private detective named Walter, who was hired by Anand to follow Nusrat.\n External links"

After that he takes her to an abandoned field where he beheads her and sets her body on fire.\n Soundtrack Later, the film focuses on Swapna  who is a single young woman and also a talented game designer. She has a fear of the darkness, and also has post-traumatic stress more so known as 'anniversary reaction', a condition, which triggers unsettling feelings around the anniversary of a traumatic event. For Swapna, it is the horrific memory of her rape that took place on last New Year's Eve.\n Marketing and release It is her second time that she suffers from the uncontrollable feeling whenever she enters darkness; the first time was one year ago, the following days after she was raped. Her symptom starts when she feels pain at her wrist, where there is a tattoo she got one year ago. As she got the tattoo too long ago, it was explained technically impossible by a doctor that the pain was caused by it, but only she knows there is a connection between the tattoo and her miserable memory. Her family have a traditional mindset that think decent girls should not have tattoos or go out in the night; to which she did not listen, and was later raped. Instead of encouraging her afterward, her parents kept blaming the tragedy on her, for having a tattoo and going out at night.\n Home media Because of this, she leaves her parents, never contacted them since, and leads a secluded life with Kalamma , a housemaid who stays with her. Her only solace is her love for gaming.  Swapna later learns that her tattoo ink was mixed with a stranger's ash, because of a mistake by the tattoo artist. She begins to have some bizarre dreams and finds that the girl Amutha , a cancer survivor, was an unfortunate victim of a serial killer.

She now realizes that she was not killed in a dream, but it is Amutha's spirit, who wants Swapna to fight, that gave her three lives, just like video games she is often playing. And now Swapna has lost one life, with two remaining.\n Box office To avoid the same mistake that got them all killed in her first life, Swapna, who is now using her second life, call the police and stay in the house with Kalamma to wait for the police. Police arrive in time and shoot the killer before the latter kills Swapna and after, however, kills Kalamma. She seems to be saved and is taken by the police to the station. But on their way, their vehicle is exploded by a bomb set by the killers. It is now revealed that there was not only one killer that was trying to kill her, but three.\n Awards and nominations Swapna now is using her third, also the last life to fight against the killers. Encouraged by Amutha's spirit, Swapna conquers her fear for darkness. She does not turn on the light to draw the killers' attention. Swapna and Kalamma manages to kill the first killer by setting him on fire. The second killer almost kills them both but is also taken down by them.

Shortly after, she discovers L\u00e9o is also in hypersleep in the damaged spaceship together with nearly 10,000 others, but she notices he lacks a scar on his forehead that he had before. Upon further investigation, through a video of a presentation  by an elderly version of her, it is revealed that she is a genetic clone with the original Elizabeth Hansen's personality and memories implanted, including memories of L\u00e9o.

It was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was shot in Berlin and Rostock.

The officer in charge tells Hanne Lindberg, Head of the Cyber Division of Europol, that Benjamin asked to conduct the interrogation. Benjamin says that he has information regarding FR13NDS , a notorious hacking group of four members connected to the Russian cyber mafia, and MRX, an infamous hacker known on Darknet; he tells her that he could give them both to Hanne if she listens to him. Having no choice, Hanne sits down.\n Reception Benjamin tells Hanne that he is like a superhero: like many heroes, he, too, has no parents; he never met his father as he abandoned the family when Benjamin was born, and his mother committed suicide when he was 8. He lives alone with his ailing grandmother. He regards his \"superpower\" as invisibility, as he was never noticed by most people during his childhood, due to him being socially awkward. He says he learned programming and hacked his first system when he was 14. Though he felt like a loser in real life, he felt a sense of belonging on the Internet. While spending most of his time on Darknet, he met his hacking hero, MRX, whose identity no one knows and who can hack into any system.

Having no prior criminal record, he was forced to perform community service as a punishment.\n References He tells Hanne that while working on cleaning the streets as punishment, he met Max, a fellow hacker, who Benjamin feels is the opposite of himself; a charismatic, cocky and confident individual. Later, Max had introduced him to his colleagues Stephan and Paul. After Benjamin proved himself as a hacker, Max explained to him that the concept of social engineering is the greatest form of hacking. They decide to form a hacking group, called \"Clowns Laughing At You\", nicknamed CLAY, and they use Benjamin's house as a base of operations, since Benjamin was forced to send his grandmother to a nursing home due to her Alzheimer's disease. They cause general mayhem around Berlin in a form of pranking, becoming popular around social media. However, MRX, with whom is Max obsessed, mocks them outright. Infuriated, Max wants to perform a more outrageous feat of hacking, and Benjamin suggest hacking the main building of BND . Impressed by this outrageous idea, the group agrees with Benjamin and decide to hack the BND in order to impress MRX.\n External links"

    "plot": "\n Plot Spiderhead is a 2022 American science fiction psychological thriller film directed by Joseph Kosinski, with a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, based on the dystopian short story \"Escape from Spiderhead\" by George Saunders and first published in The New Yorker. The film stars Chris Hemsworth, Miles Teller, and Jurnee Smollett. The story follows inmates in a luxurious prison who participate in experiments involving mind-altering drugs. Principal photography took place in Australia in 2020.\n Cast Spiderhead premiered in Sydney on June 11, 2022, and was released on Netflix on June 17. The film received mixed to unfavorable reviews from critics.\n Production Spiderhead is a state-of-the-art penitentiary experimenting with the effects of research chemicals. The test subjects, technically prisoners of the state, are volunteers for the project aiming to reduce their sentence time. The program is overseen by the sympathetic and hospitable Steve Abnesti, along with his assistant Mark. The prisoners have their own rooms, do chores, and are free to roam without guard supervision. The subjects go through daily test runs of various drugs, all of which alter their emotions and their perceptions of their surroundings.\n Development Inmate Jeff, still reeling from having killed his friend whilst drunk driving, is given N-40, a \"love drug\", which distorts his senses and drives him to have sex with two of his fellow inmates. Steve asks him to choose which one of them to give Darkenfloxx, a drug that induces intense fear and psychological pain. He declines to choose, claiming he feels nothing in particular for either one of them after the effects of the love drug had worn off. Mark helps Steve administer some N-40 to himself. \n Filming The next day, Steve brings Jeff into the observation room and tells him that the \"higher ups\" have decided that the younger of the two women, Heather, must be injected with a dose, though it will only last five minutes. Jeff reluctantly agrees, and to his horror, Heather commits suicide while on the Darkenfloxx after she damages her MobiPak, the device that administers the drugs. This causes Mark to doubt their work in the facility. As Steve rushes out of the projection room, he drops his keys. Jeff unlocks Steve's desk compartment, discovering that there are no \"higher-ups\": the prison is run by Abnesti Pharmaceuticals, Steve's company. The drugs were named from a bingo card.\n Release Steve and Jeff get high together on a laughing drug, as Steve also has a MobiPak installed. Steve tells Jeff that his father abandoned him as a child. Jeff confesses to Lizzy, an inmate he is close with, that he not only killed his friend in the car accident but his girlfriend as well. Lizzy hugs him and they kiss. Steve notices Jeff's feelings for Lizzy.

The other drugs are merely side projects being used to put B-6 to the ultimate test: whether or not they would harm their love when commanded to. The entire time inmates had been consenting to the various tests, they had really been under the influence of the obedience drug. In addition, Steve informs Jeff that he had in fact finished his sentence seven months previously, while Lizzy's appeal for release had passed the previous week. Jeff forces Steve to open the door of the main entrance to free Lizzy and then tries to order him to hand over the pocket knife. Steve resists the order , and instead takes his phone and enables all four vials of Darkenfloxx in Lizzy's MobiPak, causing her to behave hysterically and attempt suicide. The two fight for control and Jeff is able to disarm Steve, damaging his MobiPak in the process. Jeff rushes to save Lizzy, successfully removes the vials of Darkenfloxx and tells her he loves her, but Steve gets up and orders the other inmates to apprehend Jeff and Lizzy. They are able to escape from Spiderhead after overpowering some of the other inmates and locking the main door behind them. Mark and the police are now approaching the island as Steve escapes on his floatplane, but he joyously crashes into a mountain as he is now high off of his damaged MobiPak.  Meanwhile, Jeff and Lizzy take the remaining motorboat and escape.\n References In a voice-over, Jeff comments that no drug can bestow self-forgiveness, instead it must be worked on and chosen.\n External links"

It is an English-language remake of Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which was written by Amen\u00e1bar and Mateo Gil. The film stars Tom Cruise, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz , Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell. It follows a magazine publisher who wakes up in a different reality, after his lover kills herself. After surviving the car accident and being accused of murder, he plans to kill himself and join his lover in death.\n Plot The film has been described as \"an odd mixture of science fiction, romance, and reality warp\". It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Diaz was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe Award. The film has gained a cult following.\n Cast David Aames, the owner of a large publishing company he inherited from his father, is in prison. Wearing a prosthetic mask, David tells his life story to court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe.\n Production In flashbacks, David leaves the duties of the publisher to his father's trusted associates while living as a playboy in Manhattan. He is introduced to Sofia Serrano by his best friend, Brian Shelby, during a party. David and Sofia spend the night together at Sofia's apartment and fall in love, unaware that David's current lover, Julie Gianni, has followed them there. As David leaves, Julie offers him a ride, and soon reveals her jealousy of Sofia. She purposely crashes the car, killing herself and disfiguring David.\n Development Doctors cannot repair David's face using plastic surgery, forcing him to wear a prosthetic mask, but the mental and physical scarring from the accident causes him to become withdrawn and depressed. Brian convinces David to join him and Sofia at a club. They leave him in the street outside the club after he becomes drunk and insults them.\n Filming The next day, Sofia returns and apologizes to David. She takes him home, the two form a relationship and he slowly begins to recover. Doctors find a way to repair David's face despite their prior prognosis. Later, he is plagued by bizarre experiences, such as brief flashbacks of his disfigurement and an encounter with a mysterious man at a bar who informs him that David is omnipotent, demonstrated by the entire bar falling silent at David's command. One day, while at Sofia's, David awakens to find himself in bed with Julie, whose face has replaced Sofia's in their photographs. In shock, he suffocates Julie. David is arrested and imprisoned and his facial disfigurement is mysteriously restored.\n Alternate ending Dr. McCabe conducts several more interviews, which serve to help David to recall the name \"Life Extension\". Seeing a company with that name nearby, McCabe arranges to take David there under guard. Rebecca, a company representative, explains how Life Extension uses cryonic suspension to save those with terminal illnesses until a cure can be found, keeping them in a lucid dream state to otherwise exercise their mind. David realizes that he is in cryonic suspension and the world he inhabits is his own lucid dream, which has become a nightmare. He escapes McCabe and the guards while calling for \"tech support\", and rushes for the building's lobby, which is suddenly empty. An elevator opens, revealing the strange man from the bar.\n Music As the elevator climbs to the top of an impossibly tall building, the man explains that he is Tech Support and that David has been in suspension for 150 years. Unable to face the twin traumas of the loss of his love, Sofia, and his facial injuries, he had opted for Life Extension to be woken when technology could repair his face, and left the publishing company in the hands of his father's associates. As part of the program, David had chosen to experience a lucid dream, in which his life would resume the morning after Sofia left him. However, a glitch in the software had caused other elements of his subconscious to distort his dream.\n Interpretations They emerge on the rooftop, high above the clouds. Tech Support tells David that while they have corrected the flaw, he now has a choice of either being returned to the dream or being restored to life, requiring a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David chooses the latter, despite McCabe warning him against it. Before jumping, David envisions Brian and Sofia to say his goodbyes. He leaps from the edge of the building, and his life flashes before him.\n Release David snaps awake as a female voice invites him to open his eyes.\n Reception In the days after completing Almost Famous, the opportunity to keep our film-making team together was too attractive to pass up. I'd always written my own original screenplays, but Open Your Eyes, with its open-ended and impressionistic themes, felt like a great song for our 'band' to cover.\n Critical response \u2014Cameron Crowe, explaining his reason for directing Vanilla Sky.\n Awards and nominations After the American debut of Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's 1997 Spanish film Abre los ojos  at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner optioned the remake rights. Hoping to entice director Cameron Crowe, who collaborated with Cruise on Jerry Maguire, Cruise invited Crowe over to his house to view the film. Cruise has stated:\n Notes I've been offered a lot of films to buy and remake, and I never have because I felt it was too connected with the culture of that place, whatever country it was from. But this was a universal story that was still open-ended, that still felt like it needed another chapter to be told. See also The title of the film is a reference to depictions of skies in certain paintings by Claude Monet. In addition to Monet's impressionistic artwork, the film's tone was derived from the acoustic ballad \"By Way of Sorrow\" by Julie Miller and a line from an early interview of Elvis Presley in which he said, \"I feel lonely, even in a crowded room.\"\n References Principal photography for Vanilla Sky began in late 2000 and lasted six weeks. On November 12, 2000, shooting for the scene of the deserted Times Square in New York took place in the early hours of the day. A large section of traffic was blocked off around Times Square while the scene was shot. \"There was a limit on how long the city would let us lock everything up even on an early Sunday morning when much of NYC would be slow getting up,\" said Steadicam operator Larry McConkey. \"Several times we rehearsed with Steadicam and Crane including a mockup of an unmovable guardrail that we had to work the crane arm around.  participated in these rehearsals as well so we shared a clear understanding of what my limitations and requirements would be.\"\n External links"
