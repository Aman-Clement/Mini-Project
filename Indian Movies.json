On her first night, she meets her roommate Adrien, and they are forced to partake in a week-long hazing ritual, welcoming the new students. They are brought to a party, where Alexia shows Justine old class photos of students bathed in blood, including one with their parents. The next morning, the new class is splattered with blood and is forced to eat raw rabbit kidneys. Justine refuses because of her vegetarianism, but Alexia forces her to eat one. Justine leaves with Adrien and later discovers an itchy rash all over her body. She goes to the doctor, who diagnoses her with food poisoning and gives her cream for the rash.\n Reception The next day, Justine begins having cravings for meat, which makes her feel ashamed. She and Adrien take a late-night trip to a gas station so no one will see her eating meat. Unsatisfied, she eats raw chicken in the morning, and later throws up a long bundle of her own hair she had been chewing on. That night, Alexia attempts to give her a bikini wax, but when Alexia tries to cut the wax off with sharp scissors, Justine kicks her away and Alexia accidentally cuts off her own finger. Alexia faints, and Justine picks up the finger, tastes the blood, and starts eating it.

That night, she arrives at a party, where paint is thrown at her as part of another hazing ritual and she is forced to make out with someone. While kissing, Justine bites the middle of his bottom lip off, leaving the other party guests shocked and disgusted. Justine goes back to her dorm and takes a shower, where she picks a chunk of his lip out of her teeth and eats it.

Justine confronts Alexia and fights her, eventually biting each other until they are pulled apart by other students. Justine helps Alexia up, and they walk each other back to their dorms. The next morning, Justine wakes up in bed with Adrien but she notices she is covered in blood. She pulls off the blankets, finding Adrien dead with most of his right leg eaten and a stab wound in his back. Justine then sees a bloody Alexia slumped on the floor. Justine is initially furious that Alexia killed Adrien but then cleans Alexia and herself up in the shower.\n References Alexia is imprisoned for the murder of Adrien, and Justine is sent back home. There, Justine's father tells her that what happened is neither hers nor Alexia's fault. He explains that when he first met their mother, he could not understand why she did not want to be with him. Her father says he finally realized when they kissed the first time, indicating a scar on his lip. He then opens his shirt, revealing scars and missing chunks of his chest, and tells Justine that she will find a solution.\n External links"

It was also 2022's third highest-grossing film in India.\n Development In 1847, there lived a king that had a great kingdom as well as a loving wife and child, but could not find peace. He sets out on a journey to discover true happiness and comes upon a stone in a forest occupied by Panjurli Daiva , a deity that protects the villagers that reside in the forest. He donates vast portion of his land to the villagers in exchange for taking the stone with him. Panjurli warns the king that his family and successors should keep their word and not reclaim the land, which will incur the wrath of Panjurli's companion, the ferocious Goblin named Guliga Daiva.\n Filming In 1970, the King's successor asks a Bhoota Kola performer, who is possessed by Panjurli to make the locals hand over the land to him, which the performer refuses and states he will die vomiting blood if he tries to reclaim it. The successor raises doubt on performer's possession by Panjurli, to which the performer replies he would vanish if he is possessed, after which he runs into the forest and is indeed never seen again. As warned, the king's successor dies mysteriously, vomiting blood a few months later on the steps of the court, where he was going to argue the land case.\n Music In 1990, Murali, a forest officer, is tasked with converting the villagers' land into a forest reserve. However, he is challenged by Shiva, a Kambala athlete from the Kaadubettu village and the missing performer's son. Shiva is backed by his patron and the village's landlord, Devendra Suttooru, who is the king's successor in the present. Although Shiva is continually asked to perform the Bhoota Kola, he refuses due to the trauma of his father's disappearance. Instead, his cousin Guruva takes his place. Murali and his staff start erecting a fence along the earmarked forest reserve. Shiva falls in love with his friend Leela and uses his connections with Devendra to appoint her as a forest guard. The villagers try to stop the fencing, but the police and forest guards  brutally suppress them, creating a rift between Leela and Shiva even though she was following orders and could do nothing about the situation.\n Release As the feud between Murali and Shiva intensifies, Murali decides to arrest Shiva and his friends and heads to their hideout along with Devendra's henchman Sudhakara. During the search, Murali's jeep accidentally gets crushed by the trunk of a tree, which was cut by Shiva as the latter didn't expect Jeep on the way. While Murali survives with severe injury, Shiva and his companions go undercover to avoid arrest. A few days later, they return to the village to meet their families; Shiva makes up with Leela and tells her that he will surrender. However, they are caught by the police and forest guards the morning after. Guruva asks Devendra to bail Shiva, but during conversation Devendra instead tries to bribe him to act as if Panjurli orders the villagers to give him their land in the next Bhoota Kola, revealing his true intention of acquiring his ancestral land given by his predecessor to villagers. Guruva refuses and Devendra kills him; learning that Murali has figured out his ulterior motive, Devendra decides to set Shiva against him.\n Home media Having learnt about Guruva's death, Shiva meets Devendra, who lies that Murali is the Guruva's killer. Enraged, Shiva goes to kill Murali, but learns from his blacksmith friend Mahadeva that Devendra himself killed Guruva. Shiva is attacked by Devendra's henchmen, but manages to escape and meet the villagers, whom Murali has told about Devendra's land seizure. After Shiva reveals that Devendra killed Guruva, he and Murali set aside their grudge and unite the village. Devendra and his henchmen attack, leading to an intense battle where several of the villagers are killed. After nearly dying in the fight, Shiva hits his head against Panjurli's stone. Suddenly, he becomes possessed by the Guliga Daiva. Due to that possession, Shiva brutally kills Devendra and his henchmen.\n Reception A few months after the battle, Shiva performs the Bhoota Kola, and is possessed by Panjurli, where he, Murali and the villagers join hands in a symbolic gesture. Later, Shiva disappears into the forest after meeting what seems to be his father's spirit. In the mid-credits scene, Shiva and Leela's son asks Sundara about his father's disappearance.\n Box office Director Rishab Shetty cited the conflict between nature and human beings as the theme of the film, while adding specifically that the strife between forest officers and the inhabitants in his hometown Keradi, Karnataka, in the 1990s, as the source of inspiration for the film. He further added, \"It is a film from our land, from our roots, stories that are heard through generations, untapped and deeply rooted to our culture\". Shetty conceived the story in 2021 during the COVID-19 lockdown. Elaborating on the title of the film, he said, \"Kantara is a mysterious forest and this is a story that happens around the area... The film title has a tagline calling it a dhanta kathe or a legend. I did not want to give the film a straight or direct title. The word is not used often. While it has Sanskrit origins, it is used in Kannada too. It is used in Yakshagana too, where we call a very mysterious forest Kantara\".\n Telugu version The film had to present three timelines: 1847, 1970s and 1990s. Since many references through books were not available, the makers took the help of the tribes residing in Keradi where it was also filmed. Costume designer Pragathi Shetty stated that the makers \"travelled the entire village and met the tribal community, who gave details about their dress\". She added, \"We had most of the junior artists roped in from Kundapura, and it was a challenge for me to convince them to wear tribal costumes. We also took reference to design the costume for the forest guard, played by Sapthami Gowda. We heard each year, the colour of the uniform would change, and everything, including the badges was customised\". Filming took place in four forest locations in the area which included a set being built reflecting the 1990s. Art director Darani Gangeputra said, \"A lot of natural sources were used to create the setups\", further adding, \"apart from this, we created a school, temple, and a tree house. We had 35 people from Bangalore and 15 people from the Keradi village, who helped us to study the culture\". The set involved a village, including rustic homes with cowsheds, coops for hens, courtyards, areca plantations and an authentic Kambala racetrack. Shetty learned about the intricacies of Kambala and trained for four months before performing the sequence for the film in early 2022.\n Hindi version The music of the film was composed by B. Ajaneesh Loknath. Alongside him, 30\u201340 musicians were brought in. Mostly involving folklore music represented using Jaanapada songs using traditional instruments, the team took was assisted by Mime Ramdas. Songs usually sung by common people during crop harvest and those popular among the tribals of the area were used as a part of the album and the background score. The song \"Varaha Roopam\" was supposedly plagiarised from the song  \"Navarasam\" as claimed by the band Thaikkudam Bridge which released Navarasam in 2017. This song gives nostalgic feeling. When the film was released on Amazon Prime, the song was modified with a new orchestral arrangement and vocals while the lyrics remained the same. The Copyright claim and the injunction was altogether dismissed by the High Court on 1 December 2022 and the original song was returned to all the platforms. Thus, within a few days of its online release, the original version of the Varaha Roopam song was restored back in Amazon Prime.\n Critical reception Kantara was released in theatres in Kannada on 30 September 2022 in more than 250 theatres across Karnataka, and simultaneously in the US, UK, Europe, Middle East and Australia among other places globally.

Nevertheless, Venu discovers Nikitha's affair with Pradeep and invites him home to discuss. Initially, he playfully teases Pradeep but puts forward a peculiar deal; Pradeep and Nikitha should switch their mobile phones for a day not without revealing their respective passwords and if they do not have any problem thereafter, Venu shall agree to their wedding. Otherwise, they have to part ways. Pradeep and Nikitha oblige to his proposal half-heartedly but the former deletes all the messages in WhatsApp before handing over the phone to Nikitha. \n Development Pradeep returns home and Divya is supposed to be marrying Yogi after four days. Goaded by his friends, Pradeep goes through Nikitha's WhatsApp and reads her conversation with Revi, her boy bestie and discovers that he proposed to her but she rejected it as she was already indulged in an affair with Pradeep. However, the latter is disappointed with the fact that Nikitha is close to Revi and shares everything with him despite knowing about his one-sided love for her. He further perceives that Nikitha had gone on a late night long drive with her ex-boyfriend Mamakutty few days ago to Puducherry after lying to Pradeep. Infuriated, he makes a phone call to Nikitha, confronts her and questions her loyalty, leaving her in tears. The next day, Pradeep proposes to Venu that the phones not be exchanged until Divya's wedding is over and Venu complies; secretly, he suggests Nikitha to restore all the deleted messages in Pradeep's mobile phone.

Yogi meets Pradeep and discloses to him that in his mobile phone, there are several conversations in his friends' group mocking his appearance and that Divya has been the only one who understood him and admired him.

Vinoth and produced by Boney Kapoor, faced several production delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, Kapoor hinted on collaborating for the actor's 61st film and Vinoth directing the film, which would mark their third consecutive collaboration following Nerkonda Paarvai  and Valimai, which was later confirmed on September 2021. Sources reported that Kapoor suffered financial problems following the protracted production of Valimai, which necessitated a third collaboration between the actor and director, though he denied such claims in an interview before Valimai's release. Initially  Ajith planned for collaborating with a different director, but agreed to join with Vinoth after watching the rough edit of Valimai.\n Home media On 15 February 2022, the project was officially announced under the working title AK 61, and pre-production works for the film began the same time. Kapoor also shared a still featuring Ajith in a long beard with coolers in a monochrome format, which would be the looks for his film. As a part of the film's shoot, a huge set resembling Mount Road in Chennai would be erected at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad, where much of the film's shoot would take place. Vinoth recruited cinematographer Nirav Shah and editor Vijay Velukutty, who worked on Valimai, while music composer Ghibran and art director Milan, were signed on.

The official title Thunivu was announced on 21 September 2022.\n Reception In December 2022, Vinoth revealed in an interview to The Times of India, saying in response that the film is a heist film, that the film blends multiple genres and cannot be slotted under the particular genre. Vinoth said he narrated a single scene, written for a planned low-budget film, to Ajith; after he showed an interest in signing the film, Vinoth increased the scale of the project. Vinoth elaborated, \"The film is about money. It is something that we use on a daily basis, but if someone asks us what money is, how currency operates and what reference money is, we'd hardly have an idea\". He further recalled that Ajith does not play a dual role in the film, as was speculated, and his character will be kept under wraps.\n References Thunivu was reported to be trying to cast actors from \"across the industry\" in the film. In May 2022, a month after filming began, Manju Warrier was signed as the lead actress, her second Tamil film after Asuran , though she would not play Ajith's love interest. Vinoth wanted to cast an actress closer to Ajith's age and chose Warrier as he felt that \"audiences would expect a strong character from her as she's a terrific performer. Since she's done many performance-oriented roles, we decided to show a different facet of hers by having her do action, which would make her character feel fresh.\"\n External links"

Ranbir Kapoor features in a dance song.\n Cast Chillar Party won the 2011 National Film Award for Best Children's Film.\n Soundtrack Eight innocent but feisty kids lead carefree lives in Chandan Nagar, a colony in Mumbai, where each has his own identity and a nickname based on these qualities. Not only that, but their whole team has a nickname that has earned them significant notoriety. They explain that they have mainly two enemies - the 'oversized' neighbouring cricket team to whom they always lose, and a dog they named \"Loose Motion\" since she dirties their cricket pitch, so they develop an enmity against dogs. Their hopes are shattered shortly after a boy, Fatka, who was employed for washing the cars of the society, enters with his dog Bhidu. They do everything to throw the boy and his dog out, but become unsuccessful. Eventually they develop a friendship with each other as Fatka helps them by serving as the lead bowler during the match with the neighbouring cricket team. During this time, they also start interacting with a young girl who moves in, and an unemployed youngster who becomes successful after Fatka helps him out. But their happiness is short-lived when a reckless politician, welfare minister Shashikant Bhide, enters their life after his personal secretary Dubey is attacked by Bhidu for hurting Fatka.\n Track listing Bhide announces in a news telecast that all the stray dogs roaming about in residential buildings in Mumbai will be caught and terminated, misleading audiences with a concern for public safety. He further informs that the dog can only be saved if the society files a No Objection Certificate within 1 month. The kids, shocked by this, strive hard to get the NOC, wherein they have to get at least more than 50% votes of the total residents in the society i.e. 31 votes. But they manage only 10 votes after 15 days.\n Reception With more efforts gone in vain, the kids finally organize a march across the streets purely in underwears. This gains them enough traction to pull 10 more votes. With more hard work and awareness they manage to get another 10 votes counting a total of 30 votes. With only a day left for the deadline as declared by Bhide, they approach secretary L.N. Tandon, who is close to Bhide and has resented the kids all this while. Whilst all this chaos is going on, a TV channel invites Bhide and the kids for face-off. Seeing this as their last chance, they attend the interview which is being telecast across India. Knowing that that is the last day and dog catchers are after Bhidu, they pray hard to save him. During the interview they are constantly mocked by Bhide who questions their education and upbringing, but it soon takes a turn and culminates in the kids answering Bhide back with their moral education responses. Having won, the kids plead to leave after a moving speech by Fatka, and the interviewers agree. When they reach the society, they are disheartened as there is no sight of Bhidu. Suddenly, Bhidu comes jumping in, wearing a collar reading \"Bhidu- Chandan Nagar Society\". While they are happy seeing Baidu, they realize Tandon changed his mind after the face-off; he too is happy and seen cheering for them.\n Critical reception The music was composed by Amit Trivedi, while the lyrics were penned by Tiwari with Bahl, Trivedi and Amitabh Bhattacharya as guest lyricists.\n Box office Chillar Party received mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and said \u2013 \"On the whole, Chillar Party is not just for kids, but for grownups as well. A story of grit and determination, it works not just as an entertainer, but also advocates a message rather strongly. A film that deserves to be tax-exempted so that it reaches out to a wider audience. A small film with a gigantic spirit... Encourage this one!\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated it with 3 out of 5 stars and said \u2013 \"Through the entire first half, the writer-director duo holds the proceedings at a level that is completely in sync with the unpretentious spirit of the film. In the run-up to the climax, however, the film comes precariously close to tying itself up in knots as the child-like aura it builds up begins to teeter on the edge of childishness. Mercifully, it stays on its feet and doesn't topple over. For that alone the film deserves at least three stars.\" Zee News gave the film 4 stars and wrote, \"Chiller Party may be a small film. But as cinema goes, in its adroitness, it is much more mature than 99 percent of the films ever made in India. And that, you`ll reckon, is no `small` achievement.\" Sonia Chopra of Sify awarded it 4 stars saying, \"Storytelling by co-directors-writers-lyricists Vikas Bahl and Nitesh Tiwari is first-rate. They make you deeply connect with the characters\". Shivesh Kumar of IndiaWeekly awarded the movie 3 out of 5 stars. Preeti Arora of Rediff gave it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \u2013 \"Chillar Party is an enjoyable film with plenty of laughs. Do watch this, unless of course you hate kids.\" Vandana Krishnan from Behindwoods gave the film 3 out of 5 stars describing the film as \"fun filled one that is sure to leave you with a smile and moist eyes. Humor, emotions, and siddhartha is my best friend entertainment and values- You can't ask for more.\" Oneindia.in gave 3 stars while commenting \"On the whole, Chillar Party is not just for kids, but grownups also will enjoy the film equally. A story of great determination presented in an entertaining way is what makes Chillar Party a good watch.\n Accolades Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India gave Chillar Party 2 out of 5 stars and said \u2013 \"Filmmakers need to realize Indian teens are extremely smart and are fed on a regular diet of Cartoon Network and roller-coaster Hollywood kiddie's flicks. You got to have a story, adventure drama and pace.\" Soumil Shukla of FilmiTadka rated it with 2.5 out of five stars and wrote in his review \u2013 \"despite its shortcomings, Chillar Party succeeds in overcoming a lot of deformations forced by the \u2018formula\u2019 philosophy on this genre of films. If not for anything else, watch it to enjoy the delightful performances from the young actors who are the real heroes of this film.\"\n References Chillar Party grossed \u20b9630 million  in India.

    "plot": "\n Plot Jersey is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language sports drama film written and directed by Gowtam Tinnanuri, being his Hindi directorial debut and the remake of his 2019 Telugu film of the same title. Cricket action was choreographed and directed by Rob Miller of ReelSports. It stars Shahid Kapoor as a former cricketer who returns to the game for his son's wish of buying a Jersey T- Shirt, alongside Mrunal Thakur and Pankaj Kapoor. The film is produced by Geetha Arts, Dil Raju Production, Sithara Entertainments and Brat Films.\n Cast Official announcement for the film was made in October 2019. Principal photography commenced in Chandigarh in December 2019 and ended in December 2020, amidst delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Jersey was originally scheduled for a cinema release on 28 August 2020 but was postponed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was theatrically released on 22 April 2022. Despite a positive reception from the critics and praise for Shahid Kapoor's performance, Jersey performed poorly at the box office.\n Production 26-year-old Arjun Talwar  is an extraordinary cricketer from Chandigarh with the highest batting average in all of India and 106 half-centuries, fifty-two centuries, nine double centuries and two triple centuries to his name. Following the 1985-86 Duleep Trophy finals, Arjun awaits news of his selection in the India national team, only to find out his inclusion in the list was a misprint. Following this, he quits cricket. Arjun then applies for a job in the food sector and shortly after marries his girlfriend Vidya , with whom he has a son named Ketan, nicknamed Kittu . However, sometime in the early 1990s, Arjun is suspended from his job on corruption charges, although he is innocent.\n Music In 1996, Arjun lives with Vidya and Kittu in a dilapidated house in Chandigarh, with Vidya struggling to make ends meet as a hotel receptionist. Kittu loves playing cricket, much like Arjun did, and wishes to get a jersey of the Indian national team for his upcoming birthday. Arjun tries getting one, but finds out it is very expensive; he then tries to loan the Jersey in vain and Vidya refuses to lend him money for the same. His friends try pooling funds for the jersey, but fall very short of the budget. Arjun's former coach Baali Sir  approaches him to inform him of an upcoming charity match between Punjab and New Zealand, with players' fees included. Arjun's friend lies that Arjun has agreed to  play, forcing Arjun to practice for the match late at night.\n Release The next day, the New Zealand team bats impressively and sets a high target for Punjab. At first, Punjab seems to be losing the match, with very few runs and wickets falling quick. Arjun is sent onto the pitch, hitting fours and sixes with ease. Although the Punjab team eventually loses the match by one run, Arjun is praised by many, especially Kittu, for his exceptional batting. However, he is dismayed to find out that players' fees are going to charity as well. Arjun, ashamed that he was unable to get his son a jersey, tells Baali Sir that he wants to get back up playing cricket.\n Home media Officials are skeptical about Arjun, a 36-year-old, playing cricket, thinking he will not do well and will quit again in a year or two. However, they then see him play during practice, amazed by how he is able to score easily. Selections for the upcoming Ranji Trophy are underway, with only 15 out of 30 of the trainees being selected. The results come in, and Arjun is ecstatic after finding out that his name in the list. The first few matches go well, with Arjun making centuries effortlessly and simultaneously earning his teammates' respect and teaching them some of his techniques. Meanwhile, Arjun's time on the field takes a toll on him, resulting in him having to go to the hospital for some tests. Although it is said he may not be able to play in the finals, Arjun nevertheless appears for the match against Karnataka at the Wankhede Stadium.\n Distribution In the second half of the match, he is pitted against Gowda, a bowler from the Karnataka team who has effortlessly taken wickets of batsmen who had played prior in the match. Gowda proves to be a challenge to Arjun, who however manages to get to a century. Gowda tries many tricks to take Arjun's wicket. However, this does not deter Arjun from scoring. In the final over, the team barely manages to score runs due to the opposition's strong bowling and Arjun being on the non-striker end. On the final ball, Arjun needing three runs to win, attempts to hit a sixer. Despite risking being run out, Arjun manages to make the required runs for his team to win the match and the trophy.\n Reception In 2022, Jasleen Shergill, a journalist who supported Arjun during his comeback, writes a biography about him titled Jersey. At a function relating to the book, it is revealed that recently, a list of players selected for the Indian national team headed to England was found, with Arjun's name included in it. A grown-up Ketan is then called upon stage to receive a jersey with Arjun's name on it, thus fulfilling his childhood dream of getting a jersey. Ketan reveals that shortly after the Ranji finals, Arjun had to be admitted to the hospital, succumbing to heart failure caused by arrythmia, something Arjun knew he had, but chose to keep it a secret and the reason why he had to quit cricket. Ketan then ends his speech by stating that while people believed his father lost his life while trying, it was the opposite; even during hardships, Arjun never backed down till the very end.\n Box office Speculations for a remake of the Telugu film Jersey  began soon after its release. Later it was reported that Shahid Kapoor has been roped in to star as the lead actor while Shraddha Kapoor was considered for the female lead. In August 2019, Kannada actress Rashmika Mandanna was considered to play the female lead in this film and it will be her Hindi debut film. Official announcement was made on 14 October that year, confirming all the cast and crew. But later Mrunal Thakur was finalised to cast in the movie Shahid's father Pankaj Kapur was roped in to portray Coach Murthy. The principal photography commenced on 14 December 2019 in Chandigarh.\n Critical response While filming in January 2020, it was reported that Shahid Kapoor received thirteen stitches during a scene, though he later recovered. The filming was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The filming was resumed in October 2020, production moved to Dehradun and filming took place at the all-boys' boarding school, The Doon School, and Kasiga School.

Nevertheless, Venu discovers Nikitha's affair with Pradeep and invites him home to discuss. Initially, he playfully teases Pradeep but puts forward a peculiar deal; Pradeep and Nikitha should switch their mobile phones for a day not without revealing their respective passwords and if they do not have any problem thereafter, Venu shall agree to their wedding.

Goaded by his friends, Pradeep goes through Nikitha's WhatsApp and reads her conversation with Revi, her boy bestie and discovers that he proposed to her but she rejected it as she was already indulged in an affair with Pradeep. However, the latter is disappointed with the fact that Nikitha is close to Revi and shares everything with him despite knowing about his one-sided love for her. He further perceives that Nikitha had gone on a late night long drive with her ex-boyfriend Mamakutty few days ago to Puducherry after lying to Pradeep. Infuriated, he makes a phone call to Nikitha, confronts her and questions her loyalty, leaving her in tears. The next day, Pradeep proposes to Venu that the phones not be exchanged until Divya's wedding is over and Venu complies; secretly, he suggests Nikitha to restore all the deleted messages in Pradeep's mobile phone.

Yogi meets Pradeep and discloses to him that in his mobile phone, there are several conversations in his friends' group mocking his appearance and that Divya has been the only one who understood him and admired him.

    "plot": "\n Plot Raees  is a 2017 Indian Hindi-language action film directed by Rahul Dholakia and produced by Red Chillies Entertainment and Excel Entertainment. It stars Shah Rukh Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Mahira Khan. Raees is said to be based on the criminal Abdul Latif's life, however, the filmmakers have denied this.\n Cast The film was released on 25 January 2017 during India's Republic Day weekend. It received overall positive reviews from the critics, who appreciated the performances of Khan and Siddiqui, production design, cinematography and visual effects, and was a huge success at the box office, becoming  the 6th highest-grossing Hindi film of 2017 Raees was also the most pirated Hindi film of 2017 but it started trending in 2023 in Netflix after 6 years of release. The film's soundtrack has also received over 160 crore  streams on YouTube. The film received five nominations at the 63rd Filmfare Awards, including Best Actor for Khan. It became the 47th highest-grossing Indian film of all time.\n Production The film begins in the 1960s .\n Filming and development Raees, a sharp-minded boy, lives in Fatehpur, Gujarat, a dry state and gets involved in the illegal liquor trade from a young age. He uses his mother's philosophy: no occupation is low and no religion greater than any occupation as a mechanism of self-deception. Along with his best friend, Sadiq, he starts working for a local gangster, Jairaj \u2014 who prefers Raees as he comes up with novel ideas for smuggling. As his power and influence grow, he decides to part ways with Jairaj and takes the help of a crime boss, Musabhai to start his own business. He gains immense popularity in his community: he provides them liquor, employs them for receiving and delivering orders and thus enjoys political support from both the Chief Minister and Pashabhai, the leader of the opposition.\n Release Meanwhile, an honest and powerful police officer, ACP J. A. Majmudar is transferred to Fatehpur and starts a major crackdown on alcohol dealers, focusing on Raees. This affects most of the dealers except him as he manages to smuggle past Majmudar \u2014 leading to hostile relations and a failed assassination attempt by Jairaj. Raees subsequently kills him in retaliation. In the meantime, Raees marries his neighbour Aasiya and has a son with her.\n Box office At the baby shower, he convinces the CM to transfer Majmudar to the Police Control Room and takes on a new real-estate project offered to him. With Majmudar gone and construction in full swing, all seems to be going well for him. Majmudar, however, is still keeping track of his activities through phone taps and moles he planted earlier.\n Domestic Raees publicly assaults Pashabhai over a disagreement and the CM sends him to jail temporarily as a PR stunt. With Raees locked up, the CM and Pasha ally the upcoming local elections. Realizing he has been betrayed, Raees decides to stand in the elections, uses his popularity and wins.\n Overseas Seeing him as an imminent threat, the CM recalls Majmudar back to Fatehpur and declares his real-estate project's plot as protected land \u2014 rendering the construction illegal. Raees incurs huge debt to his community, whom he had convinced to invest in the project. To worsen the situation, communal rioting in the state leads to the imposition of a curfew jeopardizing his liquor business.\n Critical reception Completely broke, a desperate Raees reaches out to Musabhai for help, who offers him money for smuggling in gold by sea. Soon, serial bombings occur across India. Raees becomes aware that Musa used the gold as a cover to smuggle RDX. The police lead a massive cross-country crackdown; all of Raees's associates are either caught or killed. Heartbroken and grieving, Raees kills Musabhai and his men for using him to kill innocents. Subsequently, he surrenders to Majmudar, well aware that he will kill him. Majmudar and Raees deliberate over their time together, following which Majmudar shoots Raees. As he falls, he recalls memories from his life and his mother's teachings. Majmudar drives away, musing about Raees's last words.\n India The shooting of the film began in April 2015. The film has been shot in Mumbai, and sets were re-designed to depict Ahmedabad slums. The last schedule of the film was shot in Gujarat in January 2016. Despite protests, the film was shot in Bhuj without disruptions between January and February 2016. There was a clearance issue by the Archaeological Survey of India for a shooting at Ahmedabad at the medieval mosque and tomb complex, Sarkhej Roza.\n Overseas The film was scheduled to be released on Eid, 6 July 2016, but was postponed to avoid box office competition with Salman Khan starrer Sultan. The film was then rescheduled to be released on 26 January 2017, India's Republic Day, which conflicted with Hrithik Roshan starrer Kaabil, but then both films were moved to 25 January 2017. Raees opened to 3,500 screens worldwide. The film is streaming on Netflix.\n Controversies In March 2016, a legal notice was sent by an alleged gangster, Abdul Latif's son, Mustak, asking why a film on his father's life was being made.\n Music A few days after the 2016 Uri terror attack, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena  asked for a ban on films featuring Pakistani actors on the basis that the actors were not openly condemning terrorism. Raees was on their list because cast member Mahira Khan is Pakistani. MNS put forward a condition to lift the ban, that producers shall never cast Pakistani artists in future and they have to give crores as penance to the Indian Army welfare fund, but the Indian Army refused to accept it by saying sacrifices should not be politicised. Later, ban was lifted without the conditions on Raees as demanded by MNS.\n Marketing Farhan Akhtar, co-producer of the film said Raees will never pay, and was threatened by MNS. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra and member of the BJP and the RSS, Devendra Fadnavis said at the meeting with MNS and the producers \u20b95 crore as contribution to the Indian Army welfare fund was not quoted compulsory and was never a condition for lifting ban on films featuring Pakistani actors demanded by MNS, and earlier at an event praised Shah Rukh Khan as an \"icon\" and a \"proud Mumbaikar\".\n Accolades Worldwide, Raees has grossed \u20b9304 crore , making it the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2017 at the time, the highest-grossing January release for a Hindi film since 1994, and one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films of all time.\n Notes Raees grossed \u20b9128\u00a0crore worldwide in its opening weekend. Domestically, it grossed \u20b9177 crore  in India. With a budget of \u20b991\u00a0crore, it has a domestic net collection of \u20b9139 crore , and a distributor share of \u20b967.3\u00a0crore.\n References Raees was the most pirated Hindi film of 2017, with 62\u00a0lakh online file sharers worldwide, primarily in India and Pakistan. This negatively affected the film's domestic box office performance in India.\n External links"

A remake of Vanga's own Telugu film Arjun Reddy , it stars Shahid Kapoor in the titular role as a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend, Preeti, played by Kiara Advani, marries someone else. Adil Hussain, Nikita Dutta, Arjan Bajwa, Suresh Oberoi, Dolly Minhas, Suparna Marwah, Anurag Arora, Soham Majumdar, Kunal Thakur, Anusha Sampath, Amit Sharma and Kamini Kaushal feature in supporting roles.\n Cast Principal photography for Kabir Singh began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews with criticism directed at it glamorising misogyny and toxic masculinity, though Kapoor's performance and the soundtrack, which has become popular since release, received acclaim.  Grossing over \u20b9370 crore, it became the third highest grossing Bollywood film of 2019, and Kapoor's highest grossing solo-lead release. It became the 26th highest grossing Indian film of all time.\n Production Kabir Rajdheer Singh, a house surgeon at the Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences, suffers from severe anger management problems that gain him the reputation of a bully. After a brawl, Kabir is told to either apologize or leave, but chooses to stays upon catching sight of a new student, Preeti Sikka.\n Development Later, Kabir and his friends announce to the student body that Kabir has exclusively claimed Preeti. Initially timid, she adjusts to his overbearing attitude and eventually reciprocates his feelings, developing an intimate relationship with him. Kabir graduates with an MBBS degree and moves to Mussoorie for post-graduation. Despite the distance, their relationship strengthens over the next few years. After Preeti graduates, she introduces Kabir to her conservative parents, but her father Harpal catches them kissing and throws Kabir out.\n Writing Harpal continues to oppose their relationship, despite Kabir's attempts to explain their love. Enraged, Kabir demands that Preeti choose between him and her family within the next six hours, or he will end their relationship. Preeti fails to reach back to him in time; feeling abandoned, Kabir injects himself with morphine and remains unconscious for the next two days. Upon gaining consciousness, he learns that Preeti is being forced into an arranged marriage and gatecrashes the wedding party; Harpal has him beaten and arrested. After Kabir is released, his father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family for his antics.\n Casting With his friend Shiva\u2019s help, Kabir finds a rented flat and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he abuses drugs and alcohol, attempts one-night stands, has casual relationships, and names his new pet dog Preeti \u2014 none of which are successful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a high-functioning alcoholic both respected and feared by the hospital staff. His self-destructive behaviour and obsession worry his friends.\n Filming While hungover on a day-off, Kabir is called in to perform an emergency surgery for which he unwillingly agrees. During the procedure, he collapses from dehydration. Suspicious, the hospital staff takes his blood samples, which contain traces of alcohol and cocaine. A case is filed against him and during an in-house hearing, a broken Kabir admits to alcoholism and violation of medical ethics. As a result, his medical license is suspended for five years and he is evicted from his flat. The next morning, he learns of his grandmother\u2019s death; at the funeral, he and his father reconcile. Kabir also resolves to quit his habits.\n Soundtrack Some days later, Kabir spots a pregnant but dejected Preeti sitting in a park. He approaches and offers to raise the child with her if she is unhappy in her marriage. Initially silent, she bursts into angry tears, berates him for discarding her, and ordering him to leave. Shiva then describes Kabir's obsession and self-destructive habits, which she was unaware of. Shocked, she confesses that she left her husband three days after the marriage and has been working in a clinic to support herself. Overcome with anger, especially after hearing about his casual affairs, she had refused to contact him. She reveals that her marriage was never consummated and that the child is Kabir\u2019s. They marry and reunite with their families, with Harpal apologizing to them and the families coming together. The film ends with them on their honeymoon, on a beach, with their baby.\n Marketing After the success of his debut, the 2017 Telugu film Arjun Reddy, writer and director Sandeep Reddy Vanga wanted to remake it in Hindi with Ranveer Singh. When it did not work out, he approached Shahid Kapoor. However, producers Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde of Cine1 Studios, who acquired the remake rights for Hindi, wanted Arjun Kapoor to play the male lead. Disappointed, Vanga said, \"I've come to know that the remake rights of Arjun Reddy have been sold and it would star Arjun Kapoor. I am caught in a dilemma, as I've already locked Shahid for the role. It's a very embarrassing situation for me. I don't know how I'll face Shahid.\" In April 2018, however, it was officially announced that Shahid Kapoor would star, with Vanga returning as director.\n Release Bhushan and Krishan Kumar of T-Series also produced the film. The dialogue was written by Siddharth\u2013Garima. Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran was selected as the cinematographer and Aarif Sheikh as editor. Vanga was confident that the remake would be even more hard-hitting than the original: \"When I made Arjun Reddy, I wasn't sure where to draw the line in terms of representation of certain things. I don't think I'd have to restrict myself when it comes to the Hindi version. I believe I'll have more freedom in Bollywood.\" The film's title Kabir Singh was announced on 25 October 2018.\n Reception Like the Telugu original, Kabir Singh too begins with a voiceover from the hero's paternal grandmother, but this time she is reciting a Kabir Doha. There are also geographical changes; the remake is set primarily in Delhi and Mumbai. Instead of caste conflict as in Arjun Reddy, the heroine's father takes offence to Kabir's smoking and not being a turban-wearing Sikh. For the remake, Vanga said he deployed less English than the original. \"I've also tried to retain the colloquial quality in the Hindi dialogue.\" About the name Kabir Singh, he said, \"There's a lot of melancholy in the name Kabir and a poetic side too.\" Vanga explained his reasons for choosing this as the film's title: \"When we started work on the Hindi script, it was a very exciting journey. Kabir Singh, as the protagonist's name, came naturally, considering the character's graph. Kabir Singh has the same punch and madness of Arjun Reddy.\"\n Critical response Shahid Kapoor portrays the title character, Kabir Rajdheer Singh. Although Kiara Advani was Vanga's first choice for the female lead character Preeti, things failed to materialise. Tara Sutaria was then announced, but left when a delay in the production of her debut film Student of the Year 2  caused scheduling conflicts. The makers then went back to Advani to play the role of Preeti, Vanga cited her performance in M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story  as one of the reasons. According to Vanga, \"Kiara epitomises the female character in the film to the T. She has the perfect combination of innocence  and maturity  that's so important for the character\". Arjan Bajwa was initially uninterested in playing Kabir's elder brother Karan Singh, but accepted at the insistence of Vanga, for whom he was the only choice to play the character. Amit Sharma, who appeared as Amit in the Telugu original, was chosen to reprise his role.\n Box office The makers considered beginning the shoot in August, but it was delayed to September as Vanga wanted Kapoor to grow his beard more for the role. Principal photography eventually began on 21 October 2018 at Mumbai, four days before the announcement of the title. Filming also took place at Delhi and Mussoorie. Kapoor dons three different looks for the film. Regarding this he said, \"There's a certain mind space and the present which the character is in and there's also the past which he has been part of. Along with this, there's the culmination. So, there are three distinct energies that the film needs.\" He went through substantial workouts to portray Kabir in two time periods; to achieve the character's \"college boy\" look, he shed 14 kilos of weight, and for the \"puffy, groggy alcoholic\" look, he worked out in a way that he would look \"bigger but not muscular\". Principal photography wrapped on 29 March 2019.\n Home media The soundtrack is composed by Mithoon, Amaal Mallik, Vishal Mishra, Sachet\u2013Parampara  and Akhil Sachdeva with lyrics written by Irshad Kamil, Manoj Muntashir, Kumaar and Mithoon. Harshavardhan Rameshwar composed the score. The song \"Bekhayali\" was popular even before its release, with several cover versions available on YouTube.\n Awards and nominations In a first-of-its-kind marketing deal, Kabir Singh became the first Bollywood film to have its very own theatre. As many as 15 PVR theatres in 15 cities across India would be renamed as \"Kabir Singh Ka Theatre\", with auditoriums reflecting the characteristics of the title character played by Kapoor.\n References Kabir Singh was released on 21 June 2019, worldwide on 3616 screens including 3123 screens in India. It is distributed by AA Films within India. Khetani chose not to release the film in Pakistan, following the 2019 Pulwama attack. The film received an 'A'  certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification  with the CBFC asking the makers to modify a scene where a character is seen snorting drugs, and also asked for insertion of static warning messages against drug abuse in all such scenes.\n External links"

Ratna empathises with Ashwin as he is stuck in Mumbai for his family, and is not able to follow his dream to write. They sync emotionally.\n References Ratna gifts Ashwin a handmade shirt for his birthday. He wears the shirt to work that same day, agreeing to Ratna's request not to tell anyone she made it for him. Meanwhile Ratna learns that her sister is getting ready for marriage before completing her diploma. She is disappointed to know her sister is more enthusiastic to come to Mumbai than to complete her studies. But Ashwin consoles her by saying that the groom might be a good person, who wants his wife to be independent. He gives her some money as a gift for her sister's wedding even though she resists. He calls her when she is away for the wedding to check in with her. The attention makes her uncomfortable, and emotionally confused.\n External links"

The film stars Alia Bhatt as the titular character with Ajay Devgn, Shantanu Maheshwari, Vijay Raaz, Indira Tiwari, Seema Pahwa, Varun Kapoor and Jim Sarbh in pivotal roles.\n Cast The film is loosely based on the true story of Ganga Jagjivandas Kathiawadi, popularly known as Gangubai Kothewali, whose life was documented in the book Mafia Queens of Mumbai written by S. Hussain Zaidi. The film depicts the rise of a simple girl from Kathiawad who had no choice but to embrace the ways of destiny and swing it in her favour.

She refuses to become a prostitute, so she is tortured by brothel madame Rashmibai. Later, Gangubai is asked to persuade Madhu. She meets Madhu and tells her own story to her.\n Casting Born into an affluent family in Kathiawad, Ganga Jagjivandas Kathiawadi, a daughter of a barrister, aspired to become a Bollywood actress. At the age of 16, she eloped with her boyfriend Ramnik Lal to Mumbai as he promised Ganga a film career under the tutelage of his aunt Sheela. Her whole life turned upside down as he sold her to a brothel owned by Sheela Masi in Kamathipura for Rs 1000, where she forcefully had to become a prostitute. She later changes her name to Gangu. While there, she befriends a woman named Kamli. A man named Shaukat Abbas Khan visits the brothel and attacks Gangu.

Gangu becomes the madame of her brothel after Sheela Masi dies, renames herself Gangubai, and goes on to become a powerful political figure.\n Filming After listening to Madhu, she frees her from the brothel and sends her home safely. Gangubai later falls in love with a young tailor, Afsaan Razzaq who also reciprocates her feelings. However, she arranges his marriage to Roshni, the daughter of a fellow prostitute named Crystal to save Roshni from being a prostitute, as she can't marry Afsaan herself due to being a sex worker.\n Soundtrack She runs in the Kamathipura presidential elections against Raziabai and wins after showing movies during Razia's speech to draw people away. In this new role, she advocates for women's rights. While in office, Gangubai calls her family for the first time in 12 years and finds out that her father has died and her mother has not forgiven her for running away.\n Release Later, she finds out that a ward secretary intends for everyone in Kamathipura to be vacated during a meeting with Rahim Lala. The secretary wishes to build skyscrapers in the neighbourhood with the support of a school which accuses Kamathipura of being a site of immorality. Rahim Lala rejects the secretary's deal and warns Gangubai to prepare herself to be sued and brought to court.\n Theatrical Gangubai walks into a meeting with a journalist and school principal with the children of the brothel. There, she offers five years' fees for all 8 girls and states that children from a brothel deserve an education. The girls are enrolled in front of the journalist, Mr. Faizi. However, the children are hit and thrown out of the school on their first day. At the same time, Kamli falls ill after giving birth and dies. Gangubai takes in Kamli's child, Pammi. Mr. Faizi prepares a speech on education for prostitutes for Gangubai to read at a rally, but she does not follow the script. Instead, she asks the audience why prostitutes are the target of discrimination when they do not discriminate when providing services. She also says that she will fight for prostitutes' children to receive an education and for prostitutes to be given respect in society. After her speech goes viral, Gangubai receives Mr. Faizi and a local politician in her brothel. The politician asks for her votes and informs her that the school which wants her brothel vacated has submitted a petition to the Supreme Court.\n Home media Gangubai prepares a trip to New Delhi to meet with the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

    "plot": "\n Plot Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India  is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language epic sports drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.\n Cast Produced on a budget of \u20b925 crore , Lagaan was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan's foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of the sports drama Naya Daur  in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar.\n Production Lagaan was theatrically released in India on 15 June 2001, clashing with Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. It received critical acclaim for Gowariker's direction, Khan's performance and the film's anti-imperialist stance. With earnings of \u20b965.97 crore  during its initial release, the film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001. Lagaan was screened at numerous international film festivals and garnered multiple accolades. It was the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India  and Salaam Bombay! . Lagaan became the most-awarded film at the 47th Filmfare Awards with eight wins, including Best Film, Best Director for Gowariker and Best Actor for Khan. At the 49th National Film Awards, the film won eight awards, including Best Popular Film.\n Development The farmers of Champaner village in the Central India Agency depend on monsoon rains for their livelihood. A delayed start to the monsoon has them worried and they head to the ruling British cantonment, to ask the King of Champaner, Puran Singh for an exemption from the year's tax . \n Casting A cricket match is underway between British officers. A young farmer named Bhuvan, provokes them by calling cricket a \"childish game\". Following the match, the local Raja  rejects the farmers' plea, but Andrew Russell, the captain of the British regiment, steps in. He offers a wager in exchange for the farmers playing against his team in a match of cricket. Should they win, he would cancel their tax for the next two years. Bhuvan is made to decide for the village, and agrees when Andrew raises the stakes. \n Pre-production The village elders are nervous at the prospect of losing the game and being required to pay triple the usual tax. Bhuvan refuses to apologise to Andrew or retract his decision, so the match must be played. Andrew's sister, Elizabeth, takes pity on the farmers. She offers to teach them the game in the interest of fairness. Bhuvan starts gathering a team of players for the match. \n Filming An unruly competitor, named Lakha, is part of Bhuvan's team. He has a grudge with him for their common interest in Gauri, daughter of the village medic. He informs Andrew of his sister's actions. Andrew forbids Elizabeth from leaving the cantonment. He is unaware that she has grown attached to the farmers and is also developing romantic feelings for Bhuvan. She continues sneaking out with the aid of local staff, and even attends a village festival. Gauri, who is secretly in love with Bhuvan, starts to grow envious of her.\n Music The match-day dawns and the ground fills with spectators from neighbouring villages. The British team bat first . The farmers must score one run more than the British before the match ends in three days. Smith and Burton begin well, with Smith getting a reprieve due to a Deva no-ball. However, the farmers fight back with Bhura running Smith out and Goli bowling out Burton. Andrew and Brooks bat well and end the day at 182/2. The farmers find out about Lakha's betrayal and he is almost killed, before Bhuvan saves him. Lakha takes a diving catch to dismiss Brooks on the second day.  Their inexperience shows, however, as their batsmen start getting dismissed early on while playing rashly. Bhuvan steadies the innings and takes the match into the third day. On the final morning, the farmers must achieve the score with weak batsmen remaining. Bhuvan plays sensibly, and the match enters the last over. Kachra, the striking player, scores one run off the last ball, but it is not enough to win. The British field umpire signals a no-ball , causing it to be replayed. Bhuvan scores six runs off the next ball and wins the match for the farmers. \n Release Elizabeth rushes to the grounds to find Bhuvan. She is heartbroken when she sees him tightly embracing Gauri, and returns to the cantonment. In the next few weeks, the British Empire orders disbandment of the regiment for the humiliation caused by losing to commoners. The tax collection is cancelled for three years, and Andrew is relocated to Central Africa for his improper management of the Treasury's funds. As her caravan departs, Elizabeth steps out to meet the villagers for the last time. Bhuvan remains unaware of her feelings for him, but thanks her for her help. She bids the villagers farewell and returns to England, choosing to remain unmarried, while Bhuvan marries Gauri in a grand ceremony in the village.\n Home media Lagaan was inspired by Naya Daur , a sports drama film directed by B. R. Chopra, written by Akhtar Mirza and Kamil Rashid, and starring Dilip Kumar, Vyjayanthimala and Ajit Khan.\n Reception Director Gowariker has stated that it was almost impossible to make Lagaan. He went to Khan, who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script. Khan had initially rejected the idea of a \"sporty\" film, but was \"himself in tears\" upon hearing the full dialogued script. Even after securing Khan, Gowariker had trouble finding a producer. Producers who showed interest in the script wanted budget cuts as well as script modifications. Eventually, Khan agreed to Gowariker's suggestion that he would produce the film. Khan corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Gowariker, the story and script of the film, and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce Lagaan. He also said that by being a producer himself, he was able to give greater creative freedom to Gowariker. He cited an example:\n Box office \"If the director tells the producer that he wants 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them.\" Critical reception Jhamu Sughand co-produced the film because he liked the emotional and patriotic story. Lagaan was made on a then-unprecedented budget of \u20b9250 million , the highest for an Indian film of the time.\n Awards Gowariker first thought of having Shah Rukh Khan, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan and Abhishek Bachchan for the role of Bhuvan. After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with J. P. Dutta's Refugee , Khan was approached with the idea.\n See also Several actresses had offered to act in the film, but Khan needed someone who matched the description of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates to accommodate the film, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das, Shamita Shetty and Ameesha Patel were approached for the role, Gowariker selected Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film. Since the script also demanded a British cast, Gowariker and Khan hired Danielle Roffe as one of the casting directors. After Danielle and Gowariker screen-tested many, Shelley and Blackthorne were chosen for the prime roles. Overall, the film cast 15 foreign actors.\n References Raghubir Yadav played the role of the legendary Haji Nasruddin in the teleplay Mullah Nasiruddin and has given many memorable performances such as Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne. Yadav was selected for the role of Bhura, a poultry farmer, based on his performance in Earth . He had undergone an appendectomy operation in-between the filming schedule and returned to complete some of his scenes. Rajesh Vivek, who played the fortune teller Guran, was spotted by Gowariker in the film Junoon . His liking for cricket helped him in his role. Raj Zutshi friendship with Khan and association in several films brought him the role of Ismail the potter after auditions. Pradeep Rawat's association with Khan in Sarfarosh  brought him the role of Deva, a Sikh ex-sepoy, which was initially intended for Mukesh Rishi. Rawat claimed that it was the highest ever compensation he received in his career. Daya Shankar Pandey, who preferred the role of Kachra, was known to Khan and Gowariker through previous films , Baazi  and Ghulam ). Pandey credited Gowariker for his acting in the film as Goli, saying that Gowariker and he would discuss the required emotions and expressions before shooting.\n Further reading Yashpal Sharma was chosen by Gowariker for the role of Lakha, the woodcutter, after his portrayal in Samar . He said it was a good experience working with Khan and Gowariker during the film. Amin Hajee earlier worked in a film with Gowariker. The friendly association brought Gowariker to him with the script, which he liked, and thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role of Bagha, a mute drummer. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped him better prepare for his role. Gowariker, who believed that Amin was like Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming. Aditya Lakhia's association with Gowariker in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa  and Pehla Nasha  brought him the role of Kachra, the untouchable. He read the book Everybody Loves a Good Drought by P. Sainath to better understand and portray his character.\n External links"

Cast In the fictional Middle Eastern city of Al-Barkat, Ankit Sethi is the owner of a diamond insurance company who owes a huge debt as the company's workers had misplaced a client's diamonds worth \u20b920 crores. He meets Neha Grover, a flight attendant, on a flight and is instantly attracted to her. They later go out on a date and Neha starts liking him as well. They begin a relationship and sometime later, Neha announces that she is pregnant. Ankit proposes to marry her and she accepts. They both are attacked by a pair of goons working for the client to whom Ankit owes the debt. Neha is severely injured, which leads to her miscarriage. Seeing no other way to pay back the huge debt, they both decide to pull off a robbery. Minister, Harish Sanyal would be smuggling diamonds from Al-Barkat to India by plane, which would be carried by a courier appointed by him and Ankit would accompany him. A cellphone with its back cover laced with the diamonds would be kept inside a briefcase which would be locked by a code number. Ankit strikes a deal with Sanyal's secretary to reveal the code number to him and in return he would give him half the diamonds. Once on the flight, Ankit and Neha put their plan on motion - Neha deliberately spills food on the courier's clothes while serving the passengers, and he heads to the washroom to clean up the mess. Seizing the opportunity, Ankit goes to retrieve the diamonds from the briefcase, but just then a group of masked terrorists arrive, announcing that they have hijacked the flight, and hold all the passengers hostage.  Release The hijackers order the pilots to land the plane on Kullu and demand that Adil-Mir, a terrorist who is held up in a prison in Manali, be released immediately. Ankit pretends to be suffering from asthma and requests the hijackers to allow him to get his inhaler from the other compartment, so that he can secretly steal the diamonds. But before he can steal the diamonds, one of the hijackers senses that he is lying, and beats him up. When government officials contact the hijackers, they head towards the cockpit to talk to them on the telephone and Ankit again sneaks into the other compartment to steal the diamonds. He takes out the diamonds from the briefcase and puts them in his own bag. Just then, one of the hijackers arrives and discovers the diamonds. Before he can shoot Ankit, he knocks the gun out of his hand and they both engage in a brutal fist fight. The other hijackers also arrive and together beat Ankit and lock him up in the washroom. Just then, a man named Sudhanshu Roy, who claims to be the Flight Marshal, picks up the gun dropped by one of the hijackers, and shoots all of them down, supposedly killing them. The passengers are safely evacuated from the plane.  Music The hijackers had attached a bomb to Ankit's body and the bomb squad arrive to diffuse it, but the bomb turns out to be fake. Moreover, the dead bodies of the hijackers are not found on the plane and Sudhanshu is found to be is missing as well. It is revealed that the real Flight Marshall is Bhanu Yadav, who was unconscious throughout the flight, and that Sudhanshu was an impersonator. RAW officer Parvez Shaikh arrives with his team to investigate the matter and interrogates all the passengers. Bhanu reveals that he was served a glass of orange juice on the flight, and that he may have fallen unconscious after drinking it. Ankit finds out that the diamonds stolen by him are fake. It is revealed that Ankit had pretended to be in love with Neha so that he can receive her help in pulling off the robbery on the flight.  Reception It is also revealed that Neha had discovered the truth that Ankit was only using her for his own benefit. She had contacted her old accomplice, Sudhanshu, and they had together hatched the plan to carry out a fake hijacking of the flight and steal the diamonds themselves, to take revenge on Ankit. They had brought together a team including Jinu, Nikki and Abbas, who would board the flight posing as passengers and later wear masks and act as the hijackers, and Gaffar, who would make artificial guns for them. Neha would spike the drink of Bhanu, making him fall unconscious, and Sudhanshu, pretending to be the Flight Marshal, would replace the diamonds with fake ones, pretend to kill the hijackers by firing a blank bullet, and escape, while the hijackers would blend in with the passengers after removing their masks.  References Neha makes an anonymous phone call to Sanyal and pressures him to order Parvez to stop the investigation and cover up the matter, or else she would bring out the truth of him smuggling diamonds. The case is closed and it is brought in front of the media and the general public that there had indeed been a hijacking and Bhanu is hailed as a national hero for killing the hijackers. Neha forwards a text message to Sanyal's phone, which shows that Ankit had received the code number to the briefcase on his phone. Realizing that he had tried to steal the diamonds, Sanyal brutally tortures Ankit. Neha comes to visit Ankit at the hospital, where he is recovering from his injuries, and reveals all the truth to him, saying that her revenge is complete. Sometime later, Neha receives a phone call from Ankit, hinting that he is also planning to take revenge on her.  External links"

Om often expresses his feelings before Shanti's film poster and desires to meet her.\n Special appearances during the \"Deewangi Deewangi\" song  One night, he sneaks into the premiere of one of her films \"Dreamy Girl\" along with Pappu in disguise. Later that night, a drunk Om gives an emotional speech to Pappu as he dreams of becoming a great actor. Om and Pappu take small acting roles in films which are filmed at R.C. Studios, a major filming compound owned by Mukesh Mehra, a charming but egotistical person who is a wealthy and famous film producer.\n Production While shooting one day, Shanti gets trapped in a fire that grows out of control during filming. Risking his life, Om jumps into the fire and rescues her. Shanti is grateful towards him, and the two become friends. Om lies to Shanti that he is a popular Tamil film actor to impress her. He even puts an act of the filming of his feature, but ultimately tells Shanti the truth of him being a small-time extra upon seeing her genuine fondness for him.\n Development Shanti forgives Om and they spend a happy evening with each other, and she gifts him a snow globe. However, things take a turn when Om accidentally ends up overhearing a heated conversation between Shanti and Mukesh. He is shocked to discover that they have been married for two years but have not revealed it in public as that will ruin both of their careers. Shanti reveals to Mukesh that she is also pregnant with his child, leaving Om heartbroken. He avoids Shanti entirely.\n Casting The next night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of her upcoming film titled Om Shanti Om and tells her that they will cancel its production and instead have a grand marriage ceremony. Om goes to the set to meet Shanti for the last time and return her snow globe but is dejected upon seeing her with Mukesh. He leaves and throws the snow globe in a fountain pond nearby. \n Principal photography Meanwhile, Mukesh tells Shanti that his marriage with Shanti and the unborn child will destroy his successful career. In order to prevent that, he sets fire to the set and locks a horrified Shanti in it, in order to kill her and the unborn child. As he exits the set, Om spots Shanti in the flames and attempts to go and rescue her but is attacked by Mukesh's guards, leaving him severely injured. After they leave, he manages to enter the set but is thrown out of the building by a big explosion. Om staggers on the road as the set burns down with Shanti in it.\n Music Om is left devastated upon witnessing this and suddenly gets hit by the car of renowned actor Rajesh Kapoor. He takes him to a hospital with his pregnant wife Lovely Kapoor who is under labor. The serious injuries of Om result in his death while still reminiscing about Shanti.  Rajesh's assistant Nasser asks his surgeon to keep this a secret from Bela and Pappu. Moments later, Rajesh and Lovely are blessed with a baby boy, and they name him Om Kapoor.\n Release 30 years later, Om Kapoor is shown as a rich young man who is a superstar in Hindi films and is revealed to be the rebirth of Om Prakash Makhija. He experiences Pyrophobia and often comes across Bela who believes him to be her son and tries to take him to her house. An aged Pappu tries to make her understand that he is someone else but she pays no heed to him. Om also ignores her and leaves upon thinking that she has gone crazy. \n Theatrical He and his assistant Anwar Sheikh subsequently drive to the abandoned R.C. Studios for the filming of one of Om's films. Om recognizes the place and experiences some flashbacks of his previous life. He even finds Shanti's broken snow globe and is confused. That night, Om remembers the emotional speech he had given to Pappu in a drunken state when he wins the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. As he gives the same speech to the audience, Pappu watches his award function on TV and realizes that his friend is reborn as Om Kapoor. Meanwhile, a grand party is thrown for Om's success. Om remembers his whole previous life upon being visited by Mukesh, who now works in Hollywood and wishes to make a film with him.\n Screening and statics Later that night, he traces Bela and Pappu to the crawl and has an emotional reunion with them. The three plan to avenge Shanti's death by making Mukesh confess his crime.\n Pre-sale records The next day, Om manages to convince Mukesh to resume the filming of Om Shanti Om at the same ruined R.C. Studios. He auditions several actresses to find Shanti's look-alike but in vain. However, Om ends up coming across Sandhya aka Sandy, a ditzy but lovely girl who is an exact doppelganger of Shanti. He hires her without revealing his plan and ends up firing her as she is unable to act properly. On Pappu's advice, Om reveals his plan to Sandy who promises him that she will help him according to his plan. \n Home media At the inaugural ceremony of the Om Shanti Om set, Bela scares Mukesh in the disguise of an old witch, and Om and Pappu try to light Shanti's photograph on fire to remind him of his crime. Although the setup doesn't work, the photograph is supernaturally lit by fire which disturbs Mukesh and confuses Om and Pappu. Mukesh is more horrified when Sandy appears in front of him dressed as Shanti in a make-up room. Eventually, he decides to leave for US after seeing Shanti in the footage of Om Shanti Om but Om asks him to wait for some days. He eventually performs the story of Shanti's life through a song in front of Mukesh during the music launch of Om Shanti Om. However, Mukesh discovers Sandy's real identity as her body bleeds due to an injury. Mukesh attempts to chase her but is knocked unconscious by a falling chandelier. \n Legal issue After he regains consciousness, Om confronts him over his crime but Mukesh taunts him that he or his \"duplicate Shanti\" cannot convict him for the murder as there is no proof for it. Just then, Sandy reaches the scene. She reveals that after the fire in the set died down, Mukesh returned to the place. Shanti was still alive then, but he buried her alive under the chandelier. She concludes that Shanti's corpse will be found under the chandelier, which will be proof of her murder for the court. Mukesh denies her revelation and attempts to shoot her but Om attacks him and a fire breaks out on the set. He shoots him in his leg and is about to murder him but Sandy stops him, saying that Mukesh is destined to die but not in his hands. She looks at the chandelier which falls and strikes Mukesh dead. \n Plagiarism allegations The next moment, Om is shocked when Pappu and Anwar reach the scene along with \"Sandy\". As he glances back at the one in front of him, he realizes that the one who had revealed the proof of Shanti's murder and killed Mukesh was the real Shanti, a.k.a. the ghost of Shanti. She was responsible for lighting the photograph with fire and knocking Mukesh unconscious too, helping him in his plan. Om reunites with Sandy and waves at Shanti who tearfully smiles at him and disappears, having finally attained peace.\n Reception The film ends with all its cast and crew approaching the set of Om Shanti Om and the credits roll.\n Box office \n Critical response In 2002, Farah Khan worked as a choreographer for the musical Bombay Dreams in London, which she felt presented a \"clich\u00e9d and outdated version\" of the Indian film industry. She thought that the musical would not be successful if released in India. She instead thought of a new story, writing her initial thoughts about the subject on Andrew Lloyd Webber's letterhead while staying in his house. Later in 2006, Farah began to work on her next project, which was tentatively titled Happy New Year. Amid speculations that Shah Rukh Khan would star in Happy New Year, the actor rejected the first draft of the film, upon which Farah's husband and editor Shirish Kunder reminded her of the story she had conceived while in London. Happy New Year, which was to mark Deepika Padukone's Hindi debut, was put on hiatus and revived more than 8 years later under the same title.\n India Farah completed writing the first script of Om Shanti Om within two weeks. She set the first half in the 1970s as she felt the Hindi films made during that period were much more influential than those made in other periods, particularly the 1980s, which she felt was a period when \"the worst movies were made\". She also included many references to the 1970s, which were also prevalent in films of that time. She said, \"Everything in the first half is about the 70s\u2014such as the mother who overacts, mouthing clich\u00e9d dialogues. Then there are cabarets, badminton and other stuff popular during that era.\" Shah Rukh's costumes were designed by Karan Johar, while Manish Malhotra designed Padukone's costumes. The rest of the cast had their costumes designed by Sanjeev Mulchandani.\n International In addition to directing the film, Farah co-wrote the story with Mayur Puri and Mushtaq Shiekh. She was also the film's choreographer. Puri wrote the screenplay and dialogues. He completed the writing process in two months and rewrote the film's second half. Puri created the screenplay by writing his natural reaction to the characters as scenarios. He knew that despite being part of a crowd, junior artists do not want to be recognised as such, ruins their chances of landing a leading role in future. This was used in a sequence involving Shah Rukh and Talpade, who play junior artists. Puri blended different genres together in Om Shanti Om, which he felt was challenging. He used his personal memories from childhood for creating the 1970s. Shirish Kunder was the editor, while V. Manikandan was the cinematographer.\n Accolades Sabu Cyril was the film's production designer. Sabu was first offered the Mani Ratnam-directed Guru  at a time when Om Shanti Om was being planned, but ultimately chosen the latter due to his earlier commitment to Farah for her future project. Farah used two particular dialogues in the film: \"When you want something badly, the whole universe conspires to give to you\" and \"In the end everything will be ok and if its not ok its not the end\". These were used as Khan felt that it reflected her philosophy in her life. Farah stated that the film's opening scene was her most favourite in it. In 2008, Puri felt his most favourite dialogue from the ones he wrote would be the Filmfare Awards speech. The film's title derives from the eponymous song from the film  Karz . Om is a Hindu mantra; Om Shanti Om roughly translates to \"Peace Be With You\".\n Impact The film opens with the grandeur shot of the most famous songs of Karz that is Om Shanti Om featuring Rishi Kapoor and SRK as a junior film artist standing in the crowd.\n Further reading Shah Rukh was cast as the lead; he gained six packs for a song sequence. He felt Om Shanti Om was a \"happy film\".\n Footnotes Farah was advised by Malaika Arora to cast Padukone as the female lead, who was suggested by Wendell Rodricks, under whom Padukone was working. She was cast without a screen test. Khan felt that she was \"a beautiful, classic Indian beauty\" who fit the role of an actor of the 1970s. She was excited at the prospect of working with Shah Rukh and said, \"I've grown up watching  and always admired him so much. To get to work with him\u00a0... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him.\"\n References In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language. Her character was modelled after Malini and nicknamed Dreamy Girl after her the latter's nickname as Dream Girl. Rampal was approached by both Khan and Shah Rukh at the latter's New Year's Eve party. Rampal was initially reluctant to do the role as he felt it was \"too evil\" for someone like him. With persuasion from Shah Rukh, he agreed. Rampal wore a mustache in the film which was suggested by Shah Rukh. Shreyas Talpade played a supporting role as the best friend of Khan's character. After the release of Iqbal  and completing the filming of Dor, Talpade, who attended the same gym as Khan, was called for a narration of what would be Om Shanti Om. He agreed to do the role.\n External links"

Produced by Paramount Pictures, Aamir Khan Productions and Viacom18 Studios, it is an authorized adaptation of the 1994 American film Forrest Gump which itself is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film stars Aamir Khan as the title character alongside Kareena Kapoor, Naga Chaitanya  and Mona Singh.\n Cast The adaptation of Forrest Gump underwent a series of changes over a period of two decades, with Kulkarni spending the first ten years adapting the script, and another ten years purchasing the remake rights. Aamir Khan bought the rights of the film in early 2018 with the help of Los Angeles-based  producer and director Radhika Chaudhari and announced the film officially on 14 March 2019, with its title.

It opened to mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and audience, with praise for its adaptation to the new setting, faithfulness to the source material, depth, soundtrack, background score and emotion, but received criticism for Khan's performance. Against its \u20b9180 crore budget, the film generated a worldwide revenue of less than \u20b990 crore in its first week and was thus declared a box office bomb, although it became the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022 at international box office, earning more than Gangubai Kathiawadi and The Kashmir Files.\n Development In 2014, on a train bound for Karauli, a man named Laal Singh Chaddha recounts the story of his life to strangers who happen to sit next to him, while eating golgappas.

When questioned by the Indian Army Officials on why he did it and that the area belongs to Pakistan, he replies \"It is ours\". Young Sandeep grows up with his sister, Sandhya, and his parents K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi, in Yelahanka, Bangalore. As a child, he was very curious about the world around him. When Unnikrishnan took him to see a Navy ceremony with military airplanes flying in the sky Sandeep developed an early fascination with the life of a soldier. In his later years as a secondary school student, Sandeep falls in love with his classmate, Isha. Sandeep applied to join the Indian Navy without telling his parents, much to the fury of Unnikrishnan. However, the Navy rejected Sandeep's application, causing Sandeep to ultimately join the army. As the years progressed, Sandeep rises  ranks to become an NSG training officer.\n Music In 2008, Sandeep is well established in his career as a training officer for the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG and is married to Isha, but their marriage is in trouble. Sandeep asks for leave to try and save his marriage. On the same day as Sandeep's leave though, Pakistani terrorists arrive in Mumbai by boat and they proceed to orchestrate deadly attacks in the city.

His last words are \"Do not come up, I will handle them.\" But as fate would have it, he is killed in action, laying down his life for his country. Major Sandeep's parents watch in horror as the news coverage shows that Sandeep was killed in action.

The film is owned by Red Chillies Entertainment.\n Reception Mohan Bhargava is a non-resident Indian who works as a Project Manager on the Global Precipitation Measurement  program at NASA in the United States. Mohan came to U. S. for college studies and kept on living there after his parents in India died in a car accident.

External links Gowariker tries to address the lack of scientific temperament and widespread ignorance among the rural folks through the energetic number \"Ye Tara Wo Tara\", where Mohan is seen encouraging the children to experience the fascinating world of stars through his telescope. In a symbolic manner, the song rejects the defunct divisions of caste and class and at the same time, through its protagonist, tries to instill in the audience an appreciation of curiosity and observation.\n Reviews"

After the 2011 blockbuster Singham, Shetty had begun writing the script of the film but left it half-finished. The script of Chennai Express was ready for Khan as a back-up, because of the difficulty of obtaining the actor's filming dates. Upon reading the script, Khan liked the idea and agreed to star in it before the Angoor remake, causing Angoor's remake to be postponed. Shetty said the film is \"a hard-core commercial film with a romantic angle. The story is about this man's travel from Mumbai to Rameshwaram and what happens during the journey.\" About 68 minutes of footage were enhanced with CGI by Reliance MediaWorks.\n Box office Khan was the first actor to be approached with the script and was the first lead actor to be signed for the film. Rohit Shetty stated that despite the title, Khan would not play a South Indian in the film. The casting of the lead heroine was the subject of much press speculation; Kareena Kapoor, Asin and Deepika Padukone were rumoured to be involved. Shetty denied those rumours, stating that the cast would be finalised in April 2012, and that he was going to cast an established actress in the role. In October 2012, it was confirmed that Deepika Padukone had been signed to play the female lead opposite Khan, and photographs showing Padukone and Khan shooting were released. This was Padukone's second film opposite Khan, with whom she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om. Starting with this film, which was released on Women's Day, Khan wished to have the name of his female co-star appear above his own in the credits.\n India Sathyaraj was cast to play the role of Padukone's character's father, making his debut in Bollywood. Actress Priyamani was signed in January 2013 for an item number in the film replacing Nayanthara; both the actresses would eventually go on to star alongside Khan in Jawan. Other personalities from Tamil cinema, including Delhi Ganesh and Mohan Raman, appear in minor roles. The film was initially titled as Ready Steady Po. However, to emphasis on the connection with South India, the film was retitled as Chennai Express with the planned title used as the tagline.\n Overseas Filming on the project began at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai on 5 October 2012. Additional filming was done at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus with a minimal crew. Stills of the lead actor were unofficially released in mid-October 2012. In November 2012, the cast and crew went to Goa to begin filming the scenes set there. Vasco da Gama railway station was used to portray as Kalyan Junction railway station. A romantic scene on board a train passing next to Dudhsagar Falls was also shot. In December 2012, the crew went to Jakarta to film certain scenes. The Pamban Bridge also known as Annai Indira Gandhi Bridge, connecting the town of Mandapam in Tamil Nadu with Pamban Island, and Rameswaram was the scene for the song \"Tera Rastaa Chhodoon Na\".\n Records In January 2013, a shoot was supposedly scheduled to take place in Ooty, but since Khan felt that Ooty was too far from Mumbai, several locations from Ooty were reconstructed on the outskirts of Panchgani in Wai by the art director Narendra Ruharikar. It took over 40 days and \u20b9 15 million to build the required sets. Filming in Wai took the entire month of March 2013. A 10-day shooting schedule in Munnar, Kerala, began in mid-April 2013; scenes were filmed at Devikulam Lake, Meesapulimala, Wagavara and Kannimala. Filming was stopped for several days because of heavy rainfall, resulting in the schedule being slightly extended until end of the same month. A press conference was held in Munnar. In May 2013, scenes were filmed in North Goa. Padukone finished shooting on 25 May 2013. Khan flew to Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad in May 2013 to film his remaining scenes. The film has several Tamil dialogues, but to retain context no subtitles were used.\n Awards and nominations Chennai Express was produced by Gauri Khan, Karim Morani, Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur under the Red Chillies Entertainment banner. It was released internationally by UTV Motion Pictures.\n Game The score of Chennai Express was composed by Amar Mohile; the songs were composed by the duo Vishal\u2013Shekhar, and the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and Yo Yo Honey Singh. Recording of the songs began in late October 2012. The track \"Ready Steady Po\" was recorded in November 2012 by the music's composers. Several sources said that the director and actor were unsatisfied with the score. The director was reportedly asked to plan for a different musical composition. However, the composers denied these rumours. In mid-April 2013, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title track for the film, marking his return to Bollywood for playback after an absence of fifteen years. He said the song celebrated the spirit of togetherness. Initially, Balasubrahmanyam was apprehensive, but chose to sing due to the content and leads of the film. The song \"1 2 3 4 Get On The Dance Floor\" was released as a promotional single on World Music Day. On 27 June 2013, the video promo of the song \"Titli\" was released, and on 11 July 2013, the promo video of \"Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari\" was released. On 19 July 2013, T-Series uploaded a song to its official channel on YouTube; sung by Honey Singh.

The music is composed by Thaman S with cinematography handled by Nirav Shah. Godfather was released theatrically on 5 October 2022 and opened to positive reviews from critics. With gross of over \u20b9108 Crores against a budget of \u20b9100 crores, it failed at the box office, becoming the third consecutive box office failure of Chiranjeevi's career after Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy and Acharya.\n Production At Interpol's office in France, an officer is handing over his case about Abraham Qureshi who is a mysterious smuggler kingpin and godfather to his junior, stating that it was his only unsolvable case.\n Development Meanwhile, in Andhra Pradesh, CM Padmakant Reddy alias \"PKR\", the leader of the ruling party Jan Jagruti Party , dies in the hospital while getting treated. Taking advantage of the situation and believing that it would benefit the upcoming election, acting CM Narayana Varma sends party workers to riot outside the hospital. Govardhan, a truth-seeker, records a YouTube live stream and condemns those who praise PKR, claiming that he was a puppet, during his final years in the hands of a financial syndicate, which controls the entire Indian political system. He claims that the JJP party has twice the amount of money than the entire state's treasury, and the person who replaces PKR is crucial. He lists four possible candidates during the live stream: Sathyapriya, Jaidev Das, Varma, and Brahma Teja.\n Casting Sathya is PKR's daughter married to Jaidev, a notorious and discreet drug dealer, who mainly deals with real estate and Hawala scams. He is also in contact with drug lords in Mumbai, all unknown to Sathya. Varma declares himself as the most likely successor to PKR due to his seniority in the party and particularly for his lobbying skills. Brahma, meanwhile, is PKR's first child but was kept a secret from the world, as PKR did not want the public to know that he had a son with his first wife. Govardhan describes him as the \"most dangerous\" person from the list and addresses him as Godfather. Brahma's past is unknown but is now known for his contract work for corporations in Chennai, all known from Govardhan's research. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Jaidev and Varma meet the former's partner, Abdul, and tell him that PKR had given him an ultimatum, a month ago, to stop his immoral activities. With PKR's demise, Jaidev plans to fund the JJP with drug money, by offering money to the present financier. With the help of Abdul, Jaidev cuts a deal with Lukas, who agrees to transfer \u20b9750 crore , every month, in exchange for importing unchecked drug contraband into Hyderabad, once the JJP wins the election. For the deal to proceed, Jaidev has to first set up a discreet drug factory. Abdul insists that the factory should be on a government-sealed roadside. At the same time, the last rites of PKR are carried out in Hyderabad, where Sathya asks Varma to forbid Brahma from taking part in the ceremony. On Varma's orders, Indrajeet attempts to hinder his way but fails. That same night, Jaidev arrives home, where he gives some malana cream to Sathya's sister Jhanvi and convenes a meeting with the JJP ministers, informing his decision to fund the party and dissolve the current ministry, which will ensure the preponement of the elections. This will allow them to take advantage on the present sympathy wave and nominate himself as the party's next CM candidate. Since the present financier is Brahma himself, Varma advises Jaidev to negotiate with Brahma, but Brahma objects to funding the party with drug money and threatens Jaidev. Enraged, Jaidev assigns Varma to bribe 140 MLAs from the party to nominate him as the CM's candidate.\n Filming Jaidev sends men to set up the drug factory. Upon knowing this, Brahma goes to the factory and kills all of them. Brahma's aide and Jaidev's mole, Koti, witnesses this and reports it to the both of them. Indrajeet is sent to detect evidence from the factory but finds nothing. From Sathya's diary, Jaidev finds out that she resents Brahma because her father gave more care for him, who was brought to their home as a child, and was the cause of a rift between her parents. Koti persuades his lover Renuka to slander Brahma. On public news, she accuses Brahma of abusing her. This creates public outrage against Brahma, who is arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Brahma gets a phone call from his next contractor and Masoom Bhai, his most trusted aide. Jaidev arranges a hit on Brahma, by sending goons into the prison, but the attempt fails.\n Music While transferring the money to bribe the other party members in the JJP, Lukas' containers are sabotaged by Masoom Bhai. Brahma meets Govardhan, where he provides pieces of evidence of the party workers' corruption to Govardhan and also reveals the reasons for him indulging in drug trade, in Chennai. Meanwhile, Koti, who realizes his mistake, along with Renuka, admit that they lied about Brahma, on national news. Brahma is later released from prison. Meanwhile, Jhanvi is hospitalized after a drug overdose. From Jhanvi, Sathya learns of Jaidev's predatory behavior towards her. When confronted by Sathya, Jaidev admits everything and threatens to expose Jhanvi's contacts with drug peddlers. He also threatens to kill her and Jhanvi, like PKR. A changed Sathya, with no other choice, seeks the help of Brahma. Brahma, who reveals his origin to Sathya, vows to protect them. Sathya breaks down after coming to know the true face of her brother's.\n Release Indrajeet blackmails Sathya in exchange for not filing a case against Jhanvi. Brahma kills Indrajeet, with his men, following which, Brahma meets the owners of the NNTV news channel. Brahma clears the channel's debts of \u20b945 crore  and gives total control and autonomy of the channel to Sathya. Brahma and Masoom Bhai also blackmail Varma and the other MLAs to ally with him in exchange for their drug habits not getting into the hands of the media. Jaidev kidnaps Jhanvi and blackmails Sathya, from Mumbai, to announce him as the next CM. With the help of Masoom Bhai, Brahma kills Jaidev's associates. They confront Jaidev, where upon seeing Brahma, Lukas reveals that Brahma is in fact, Abram Qureshi aka \"Godfather\". Though taken aback, Jaidev attempts to have Sathya killed in a car accident, but Brahma's men save her. Defeated, Jaidev kills himself. Sathya is elected as the new president of JJP party and CM, while Brahma heads to Paris with Masoom Bhai.

With Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he chose to pair up the same lead actors, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for his own romance film. During the filming of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Khan had also encouraged Johar to make his own film, and said that he would be willing to star in it. They were signed by producer and his father Yash Johar in early 1997. Yash Johar officially announced the film in October 1997 at Mehboob Studios in Bandra.\n Reception Johar first wrote a story, which was a love triangle between a tomboy, a very pretty girl, and a slightly insensitive boy, but he shelved the idea because he was not very satisfied with it. Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually, he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: \"It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father's life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That's how the story got made.\" The story also includes a \"personal desires vs. parental loyalties\" theme and has some \"East meets West\" themes, but instead of the characters going abroad, it creates a virtual West inside India.\n Critical reception Karan Johar was certain from the beginning that he wanted to cast Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, having observed him during the making of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. It took longer to fill the role of Tina. The role was written with Twinkle Khanna in mind, but she turned it down. Other actresses such as Urmila Matondkar, Tabu, Shilpa Shetty, Aishwarya Rai, Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor were offered the role but also turned it down. Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan noticed Rani Mukerji's acting in Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat , and suggested her to Karan Johar. He thus signed her, giving a boost to her career. Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachur Singh were initially offered the role of Aman, but they both turned it down, thus prompting Johar to rope in Salman Khan.\n Box office Johar, who is also a costume designer, wanted to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema with this film. He and his friend Manish Malhotra, the film's costume designer, made trips to London for costumes, much to the chagrin of his father and producer Yash Johar, who was concerned about the budget. Many of the costumes in the film prominently displayed logos from designers such as DKNY and Polo. In addition to the designer fashions, Johar also created a somewhat fantastical world where the students speak Hinglish and enjoy a pristine college campus, where there is no crime or hate, and traditional Hindu values are pervasive. Johar admitted that the look and feel of the college scenes in the film were patterned after Beverly Hills 90210, saying, \"The art, the costumes, tilt toward the West, but the soul of the film is Indian.\" He hired Sharmishta Roy as art director, and told her to produce something similar to Riverdale High School of the Archie Comics, with some 90210 influence as well. Johar said of the outcome, \"If you see KKHH, Shahrukh plays Archie, Rani Mukherji plays Veronica, and Kajol played Betty. It was exactly that. And the principal looked like Weatherbee, and Ms. Grundy was Archana Puran Singh.\" Johar also hired Farah Khan to do the choreography, Jatin\u2013Lalit to provide the music, Santosh Thundiyil as cinematographer, and Nikhil Advani as his associate director. Shabina Khan assisted Manish Malhotra with costume design.\n India Filming began on 21 August 1997. The crew was young and inexperienced to the point where Shah Rukh Khan had to explain basic technicalities of filming. Khan later said, \"Karan makes no bones of the fact that his technical knowledge of filmmaking was not at its peak when he made the biggest hit of the decade.\" The entire film was shot in nine and half months with a substantial part of it shot in Mauritius. The title song was filmed over a ten-day period. in several picturesque locations in Scotland, including Eilean Donan, Glen Coe, Loch Lomond and Tantallon Castle with the nearby Bass Rock as a backdrop in one scene. The scenes from the summer camp in Shimla were filmed at Wenlock Downs in Ooty, Tamil Nadu.\n Overseas During the bicycle sequence in the song \"Yeh Ladka Hai Deewana\", Kajol lost control of her bike, fell flat on her face, and was knocked unconscious while also injuring her knee. During the promotional Making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai TV special, Kajol stated that the accident was her most memorable part of shooting the film because she doesn't remember it. During preparation for the reunion scene where the two leads met after more than 8 years apart, the director told them to improvise and rehearse the reactions that they might use, but he secretly taped them and was so happy with the result that it was put into the film.\n Accolades The soundtrack for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was composed by Jatin\u2013Lalit and the lyrics were penned by Sameer. This is the first collaboration of the duo with Karan Johar. It was released by the Sony Music label on 12 August 1998. While the film was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and recorded one song. However, when the movie was titled Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it decent and could see that the title has become quite a buzzword, realizing that he was the only one who disliked the title.\n Home media The album became the best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, with 8 million units sold in India. The title song remained on the Indian music charts for over a year, and the album peaked at number #2 on the Malaysian albums chart  in 1999. Sony Music Indonesia also sold 300,000 copies in Indonesia, for a combined 8.3 million copies sold in India and Indonesia.\n Legacy Mukul Deshpande of Planet Bollywood rated the soundtrack 8.5 out of 10 stars, although he did not like all of the songs. In 2012, it was voted as the most popular film song of the previous decade by NDTV.  The full soundtrack came in second place in a similar poll conducted by the BBC, the first place being taken by Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, an album which was also composed by Jatin\u2013Lalit.\n See also On 2002, Sony Music India also released Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in Telugu version.\n References While comparing the film to Dil To Pagal Hai , Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave Kuch Kuch Hota Hai 3.5 out of 5 stars. She especially liked the performance of Kajol, and thought that the film would appeal to young and romantic viewers primarily for its \"MTV ambience\" and \"Valentine's Day flavours\". On the negative side, she said \"The second half, however, gets drowned in a sea of emotions. Too many people begin to cry a bit too much.\" Anish Khanna of Planet Bollywood rated the film 9.5 out of 10 stars, calling it \"pure escapist cinema at its best.\" He praised the cinematography, choreography, set decoration, and also raved over Kajol's performance, along with her onscreen chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan. Overall, he said, \"Karan Johar makes an impressive directorial debut, has a good script sense, and knows how to make a film with S-T-Y-L-E.\" In contrast to these views, the reaction of Sujata C J, writing for Rediff.com, was that the film was very disappointing, with many cliches and a bad storyline, though Santosh Thundiyil and Sharmishta Roy were praised for their camerawork and art direction, respectively. Nandita Chowdhury in a review for India Today, said that Karan Johar was almost able to rekindle the Khan-Kajol magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, and that overall the film was \"a good distraction\".\n External links"

    "plot": "\n Plot RRR is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S.\u00a0S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the film with V.\u00a0Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D.\u00a0V.\u00a0V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N.\u00a0T. Rama Rao\u00a0Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It centers around fictional versions of two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju  and Komaram Bheem , their friendship, and their fight against the British Raj.\n Cast Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.\n Production Made on a budget of \u20b9550 crore , RRR is the most expensive Indian film to date. The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which was postponed multiple times due to production delays and the COVID pandemic. RRR was released theatrically on 25 March 2022. With \u20b9240 crore  worldwide on its first day, RRR recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film. It emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over \u20b9415 crore . The film grossed \u20b91,200 crore  \u2013 \u20b91,258 crore   worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, including the third highest-grossing Indian film and second highest-grossing Telugu film worldwide.\n Development RRR received universal praise for Rajamouli's direction, writing, performances , soundtrack, action sequences, cinematography and visual effects. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the second non-English language film ever to make it to the list. The song \"Naatu Naatu\" won the Best Original Song award at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category. The film became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for \"Naatu Naatu\", making it the first Indian  nomination to win the award. RRR also won the Best Foreign Language Film and the Best Song award at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards.\n Casting In 1920, during the British Raj, Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad and there abduct Malli, a young girl with a talent for artistry, from the Gond tribe. Enraged by this, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim man named Akhtar. Elsewhere, the Nizamate of Hyderabad, sympathetic to the Raj, warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious officer in the Indian Imperial Police, to quell the threat. Seeking clues to Malli's whereabouts, Raju and his uncle, Venkateswarulu, attend several pro-independence gatherings where he feigns to support independence. \n Design Months later, Lachhu, Bheem's gullible aide, is taken in by Raju's ruse and attempts to recruit him into Bheem's plot, but then discovers his true identity and flees. A short while later, Bheem and Raju encounter one other, unaware of their opposing allegiances. In the course of working in concert to save a boy from a train wreck, they form a friendship and over time grow close. Raju then assists Bheem in courting Jenny, Scott's niece, unaware that Bheem plans to infiltrate Scott's residence. When Jenny takes Bheem to her residence, Bheem locates the room where Malli is being held captive; he meets Malli and promises he will free her. Meanwhile, Raju deduces Lachhu's true identity and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu goads a banded krait into attacking Raju, then warns him of his imminent fate and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds.\n Principal photography Dazed, Raju approaches Bheem, who immediately tends to him. Noticing similar religious features between Lachhu and Bheem, Raju deduces his true intentions. Nevertheless, Bheem divulges his tribal identity and his mission, still unaware of Raju's true identity. At an event held in Scott's honor, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, which creates havoc among the assembled guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly fight; however, Raju arrives and tells him Scott intends to kill Malli; he surrenders out of obligation. In the aftermath of the incident, Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet he is absorbed with guilt over his own actions, recalling his own pro-nationalistic background and his actual alter-ego as a mole within the police; he was seeking a promotion in order to gain access to shipments of guns to smuggle to his village.\n Post-production At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses to be flogged instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, which incites the assembled crowd into rebellion. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally realizes the recklessness of his actions. Determined to save his friend, he persuades Scott to execute Bheem in secret while preparing an ambush to rescue him. Scott figures out this scheme. While managing to rescue Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously injured. Bheem, who had also managed to free himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him and escapes with her. Months later, Bheem, who is hiding out with his group and Malli in Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities. He narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita, Raju's fianc\u00e9e, repels them by claiming a smallpox epidemic as a pretext.\n Themes and influences Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's actual, anti-colonial objectives and of his impending execution. Crestfallen upon realizing his own folly, Bheem vows to save him. With the assistance of a sympathetic Jenny, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him, defeating the many soldiers he aroused in the process. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate more soldiers with the use of a longbow taken from a Rama shrine. Taking the fight to Scott, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting it afire. The subsequent explosion kills many within Scott's company, including Catherine. Having finally cornered a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. They steal a cache of Scott's weaponry and reunite with Sita and Jenny.\n Music To mark the completion of their missions, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community.\n Marketing In October 2017, in an interview with Variety, S. S. Rajamouli announced two projects after Baahubali 2: The Conclusion  with producers D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment and K. L. Narayana. Rajamouli prioritised his work on the former, which was touted to be a social drama film, and which would be followed by Narayana's production with actor Mahesh Babu. In November 2017, Rajamouli shared a picture with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan through his social media handles, hinting their inclusion in the film.\n Release The film was announced in March 2018, with the tentative title RRR, an abbreviation for Rajamouli, Ram Charan, and Rama Rao. The tentative title RRR was later confirmed to be the film's official title as Rajamouli felt that a universal title across the languages was essential for a film of such scale. Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad gave the original story and Rajamouli scripted the film, which he worked on for six months. In September 2018, writer Sai Madhav Burra was signed for the dialogues for the film in the primary language , whereas dialogues in other versions were written by Madhan Karky , Varadaraj Chikkaballapura , Mamkombu Gopalakrishnan , and Riya Mukherjee . Rajamouli retained several technicians from his previous projects. The crew consists of M. M. Keeravani as the music director, K. K. Senthil Kumar as the director of photography, A. Sreekar Prasad as the film editor, Sabu Cyril as the production designer, V. Srinivas Mohan handling the visual effects supervision, and Rama Rajamouli as the costume designer. Nick Powell was the stunt director for the film, and handled the choreography for the climax action sequences in the film. Prior to the start of film production, both Rama Rao and Charan had attended a special workshop in mid-November 2018, in order to train physically and intensively for their roles in the film.\n Theatrical RRR is an entirely fictitious story incorporating the lives of two real-life Indian revolutionaries, namely Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad respectively. Charan plays Rama Raju while Rama Rao plays Komaram Bheem. The plot explores their stay in Delhi of the 1920s before they begin the fight for their country. Rajamouli stated that there had been a coincidence between the two Telugu tribal leaders and the events surrounding over them.\n Screenings and statistics When I read about Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, it was exciting to know that their story is similar. They never met each other. What if they had met? What if they had got inspired by each other? That is what RRR is about. It is completely fictitious. The film is mounted on a very large scale. We had to do a lot of research for it. To know costumes, their dialect, their way of living and that is why it took so much time for us to get this together. Distribution In March 2019, Rajamouli finalized the cast. The film marks the Telugu debut of Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt. Bhatt was paired opposite Charan in the role of Sita, while Devgn would have an extended cameo. Tamil actor Samuthirakani was roped in to play a crucial role. British actress Daisy Edgar-Jones was signed to be paired opposite Rama Rao, however, she left the project in April 2019 citing personal reasons, which later revealed to be scheduling conflicts to Normal People. Olivia Morris was cast as her replacement in November 2019. The same month, Irish actor Ray Stevenson was cast as the lead antagonist Scott, with Alison Doody joining in to play Lady Scott. Chakri, Varun Buddhadev, Spandan Chaturvedi and Twinkle Sharma were the child artists for the film.\n Home media In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Rama Rao said that they had carried out major research to portray their characters on screen. He was put on an 18-month training programme to get the right physical appearance. The Hans India reported in March 2019 that Devgn will appear in the second half of the film during the flashback episodes. Reports claimed that Keerthy Suresh and Priyamani were approached for a role in the film, before Shriya Saran confirmed her role opposite Devgn in June 2020. Rahul Ramakrishna, Chatrapathi Sekhar and Rajeev Kanakala are cast in other supporting roles.\n Critical reception In June 2020, Bhatt was trolled by the netizens following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, where she was accused of nepotism. A few fans also called to replace Bhatt in RRR. However, Bhatt denied the news of her leaving the film and being replaced by Priyanka Chopra, and joined the sets in December 2020. She learnt to speak Telugu for the film.\n India Sabu Cyril served as the production designer for RRR. Prior to starting the first shooting schedule, the team had constructed a set at an aluminium factory located in Hyderabad, for filming an action sequence. A manduva house was constructed for the film actors and technicians. The first schedule of the film's shooting was held at the Aluminium factory set for nearly 20 days. In June 2020, it was reported that \u20b918 crore  was spent for a set replicating an entire village in Gandipet, where the team planned to film the sequences in this location post-COVID-19 lockdown. A set resembling the 20th-century Delhi was recreated at the Ramoji Film City, where the team had undergone an extensive action schedule for 50 days, which involved night shoots. Another huge set was constructed by the art direction crew for a song shoot featuring Charan and Bhatt. The promotional music video for the film titled \"Dosti\" was filmed in July 2021, at a specially constructed set at the Annapurna Studios designed by Sabu Cyril and photographed by Dinesh Krishnan.\n International The film's launch event with a puja ceremony was held on 11 November 2018, which saw the attendance of noted personalities from the Telugu film industry, including Prabhas and Rana Daggubati, who had worked with Rajamouli in the Baahubali franchise. Principal photography of the film commenced on 19 November 2018 in Hyderabad at a specially erected set at an Aluminium factory in the location. It is the first Indian film to be shot on Arri Alexa LF and Arri Signature Prime lens. Senthil Kumar told American Cinematographer that, he \"avoided the use of overt stylization such as extreme color palettes and unrealistic camera moves, in favor of a more classical cinematographic approach\". The filming schedule was completed on 6 December 2018. The team took a brief break before commencing the film's second schedule on 21 January 2019 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. An action sequence consisting of 1000 artists was filmed during February 2019. An extensive schedule was filmed in Vadodara for 10 days in March 2019. Few scenes were also shot at Siddhpur, Gujarat. Another schedule was planned in Pune, Maharashtra, however, it was called off following Charan's injury on the sets. Rama Rao too faced a minor injury on the sets, resulting the team to take a break during the schedule. Ram Charan's introduction scene was reportedly shot for 32 days.\n Top-ten lists After their recovery, an action sequence featuring Charan, Rama Rao and 2000 junior artists was shot, reportedly at a cost more than \u20b945 crore . Introductory sequences of Rama Rao and Charan costed the production upwards of \u20b940 crore , a sum considered higher than the total budget of many small Indian films. In August 2019, the production headed to Bulgaria to film the second schedule where the crew shot crucial scenes featuring Rama Rao. The shoot was stalled during October 2019 as Rajamouli had to attend a screening of Baahubali: The Beginning  at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n Box office In November 2019, a song featuring Rama Rao and Charan was filmed at the Ramoji Film City. The film's official social media handle tweeted that 70% of the film's shoot had been wrapped as of November. Rama Rao headed to the Modakondamma Temple forest area in the Paderu\u2013Araku road to film for five days in December 2019. In January 2020, Charan began a week-long night shoot in the Vikarabad forest region. Ajay Devgn joined the film's shooting schedule on 21 January 2020 and wrapped his portions during February. The film was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. After the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana granted permission to resume film shooting during June 2020, a 2-day trial shoot was planned, but it was halted following the spike in COVID-19 cases in Hyderabad. The filming was resumed in early October 2020 following the ease of the COVID-19 lockdown in India, and Rajamouli shot for the promotional teaser for the film, titled \"Ramaraju for Bheem\", during this schedule. Abiding to social restrictions related to the pandemic, the production unit was accommodated in a hotel in Madhapur and were barred from coming into contact with outsiders not belonging to the production.\n Accolades In late-October, the team canned night shoots for the film and stills were revealed by the official social media handles for the film under the tagline #RRRDiaries. The action sequences, which took place for 50 days, were completed by the end of November 2020. The production then moved to Mahabaleshwar to film a very brief schedule in early December 2020 The production then moved to Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad for further filming. Alia Bhatt began filming her portions in Hyderabad in December 2020, during which key scenes involving her were shot. The filming of the climax scenes began in January 2021. Action director Nick Powell  choreographed few climax war-sequences in March 2021. A special song shoot featuring Charan and Bhatt was held during the same month. Though the filming was halted again due to the second wave of COVID-19, it was resumed in June 2021. In June 2021, the makers announced that except for two songs, the filming was completed and Charan and Rama Rao had completed their dubbing work in two languages, and had completed the talkie portions for the film.\n Future In August 2021, the final schedule of the film took place in Ukraine. The song \"Naatu Naatu\" was shot during the schedule at Mariinskyi Palace, Kyiv, which is the ceremonial residential palace of President of Ukraine, filming took place some months before Russia invaded Ukraine. Barring a few shots, the entire shoot was completed on 26 August 2021. In an article published in March 2022, by News18, it was reported that at least 3000 technicians have worked on RRR, while nine co-directors also contributed to the film. It took over 300 days to complete the shooting of the film. About 75 days had been allotted to film the action sequences, and 40 fighters from other countries took part in the film. At least 2500 crew people were also hired from London. Overseas locations including Netherlands was also used for shooting some important sequences.\n See also RRR began with a budget of between \u20b9350 crore  and \u20b9400 crore  in 2019. However, the budget was overrun by around \u20b9150 crore  due to the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the film's final budget estimated to be \u20b9550 crore , thus making RRR the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. In March 2022, according to the producer's application to the Government of Andhra Pradesh for ticket price hikes, the film's budget was \u20b9336 crore  excluding the Goods and Services Tax and the remunerations of the director and star cast.\n Notes Post-production of the film began simultaneously with the wrapping-up and continuation of film production. The dubbing process began during April 2020, with Rama Rao and Charan dubbing their portions for the film from their homes, and thus being the first persons to do so. Both actors gave voiceovers for each other's introduction teasers. In June 2021, the film producers reported that both actors had completed dubbing for the film. On 26 August 2021, after filming was completed, the film entered into an extensive post-production phase. With three years already invested in the film, Rajamouli's decision to spend less time in post-production compared to his other films was due to future commitments, rising production costs, and filming postponements caused by COVID-19 restrictions. The dubbing works were completed by late October 2021. Both Rama Rao and Charan dubbed their lines for four languages, namely Telugu, Hindi, Tamil and Kannada.\n References V.

    "plot": "\n Plot PK  is a 2014 Indian Hindi-language  science-fiction comedy-drama film edited and directed by Rajkumar Hirani and written by Hirani and Abhijat Joshi, and jointly produced by Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra under the banners Rajkumar Hirani Films and Vinod Chopra Films respectively. The plot follows an innocent alien  who lands on Earth but loses his communication device. He meets Jaggu , a heartbroken reporter, and tries to find his device. With time, he raises many thought-provoking questions.\n Cast After the success of 3 Idiots , Hirani and Joshi began scripting their next project; finding similarities with the plot of Inception , they scrapped the film. It was later rewritten with a different angle and tone. During production, the film was initially titled Talli and later Ek Tha Talli before being changed to PK as the latter title was found to be too similar to Ek Tha Tiger . The film's soundtrack was composed by Shantanu Moitra, Ajay\u2013Atul and Ankit Tiwari with lyrics written by Swanand Kirkire, Amitabh Varma and Manoj Muntashir. UTV Motion Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures acquired the distribution rights of the film. PK was the first Bollywood film to be shot in Belgium.\n Production PK was released on 19 December 2014. Upon release, it received positive reviews, with praise directed towards Khan's performance and the film's humour. The film received 8 nominations at the 60th Filmfare Awards, winning two. Additionally, it won five Producers Guild Film Awards, and two Screen Awards. PK garnered the Telstra People's Choice Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Produced on a budget of \u20b91.22\u00a0billion, PK was the first Indian film to gross more than \u20b97\u00a0billion and US$100\u00a0million worldwide. At the time of its release, it emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of all time. The film's final worldwide gross was \u20b9769.89 crore . It currently stands as the 8th highest grossing Indian film of all time. and 9th highest-grossing film in India.\n Development A humanoid alien lands on Earth naked on a research mission in Rajasthan but is stranded when the remote control for his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in Belgium, an Indian woman, Jagat Janani Sahni alias Jaggu, meets a Pakistani, Sarfaraz Yousuf, and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father objects to their relationship, citing difference in their religions. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the wedding due to cultural differences.\n Casting Jaggu returns to India and becomes a news reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's collection box as a refund on God's broken promises. The alien tells her that he is an 'astronaut' from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication; they transfer ideas by holding hands.\n Characters A flashback shows how, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh, who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute Phuljhadiya's hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. The alien begins speaking, and after learning of the whole scenario, Bhairon tells him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behaviour, people assume he is drunk and call him \"peekay\" or \"PK\" ; the alien adopts PK as a name . People tell PK that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. He sincerely practices Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find \"God\", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.\n Title PK conjectures, as Jaggu plays a prank on an unknown caller, that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a \"wrong number\" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen by sending their videos to her news channel. This \"wrong number\" campaign turns into a popular mass movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a \"wrong number\". Bhairon brings the thief to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack.\n Themes Tapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.\n Filming Jaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy receptionist tells her that Sarfaraz has been annoying the embassy officials by repeatedly asking if they received a call from Delhi, implying that he still loves Jaggu. That day, Sarfaraz found the same letter and thought it was from Jaggu, and did not call her as he understood she was under familial pressure. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced by Jaggu's father to return PK's remote.\n Marketing Meanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. He lies to Jaggu that the tapes contain a variety of Earthly noises which he will miss, such as crows and car horns. Jaggu realises his love for her by seeing the note he wrote for her earlier but does not directly confront him about it. PK does not even look back while going as he doesn't want her to see him in tears which will give away his love for her. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him, with Sarfaraz and her family assisting.\n PK: The Game One year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with more members of his species.\n Release \"PK\" was the only film which began with a desire to say something. I can't say what that thing is. The battle was the other way round\u2014how do you say such a serious thing in an entertaining way? For many years, we were struggling, until we finally found a way, where it will be entertaining, won't be offensive\u2014will hit the right notes, basically.\n Distribution \u2014Rajkumar Hirani, director of pk, in an interview to India Insight.\n Soundtrack After the success of 3 Idiots, director Rajkumar Hirani and writer Abhijat Joshi started work for the next project. They had written a story about a character who had the ability to get into another person's mind to make that person a better human being. They spent one year to write a story, but it turned out to be similar to Inception . After watching Inception, Hirani and Joshi were shocked by the similarities. Eventually, they decided to scrap the film, then Hirani and Joshi reworked on the script, changing the entire tone and angle. It took five years to make the film and three years to write it.\n Track listing In PK, Khan played nine avatars and, during the course of the film, the actor had to chew over 10,000 betelnut preparations called paan.\u200a Betelnut is a psychoactive stimulant used throughout Asia and characterized by its ability to stain users' mouths red. \"In real life paan is not a habit, I have it once in a while but for this film I chew paan for every scene. I would at times eat about 100 paans in a day. We had a paanwala  on the sets,\" said Khan in the report. For every take, Khan had to eat a fresh paan to fill his mouth. Before beginning the shoot, he would eat at least 10\u201315 paans to get the right color inside his mouth and on his lips.\n Reception Viral Thakkar was the visual effects supervisor. The visual effects company was Riva Digital at a point employing 100 artists working on the film.\n Box office In 2011, Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma signed on for the film. Khan's nephew Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were considered for a role which eventually went to Sushant Singh Rajput before the release of his debut movie Kai Po Che . Earlier reports said that Rajkumar Hirani had signed Arshad Warsi for the film when it was reported that Arshad will be playing an important role. In 2013, Warsi said in an interview \"I couldn't have worked out on dates. I wouldn't refuse Raju for anything. In fact, when he offered me the film, I did not even ask for the script, I was like I am ready to come on whenever you want. So that is the connection I share with Raju.\" Before Rajput and Warsi were signed on, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were said to be cast in the film. Junaid Khan, son of Aamir Khan worked as an assistant director in this film.\n Domestic In 2011, in its initial scripting stage, Hirani named the film Talli, then changed it to Ek Tha Talli which he loved, but later on came to know that Ek Tha Tiger was already in production . He dropped the idea and, after many titles, he came up with a title that only had initials, PK. After starting the film, Hirani felt PK was not a good enough title. He decided to change the title to Talli. But after a few weeks of shooting, Hirani decided to go back to the original title.\n International Firstpost compared PK to Hirani and Khan's previous collaboration 3 Idiots, as they both involve \"A socially awkward and 'different' young man\u2014who walks and talks in a strange, enthusiastic childlike manner\u2014observes the system, questions it, asks you to look at the many ludicrous things that inform it, and eventually brings about a minor revolution.\"\n East Asia According to Hirani, PK is a \"satire on Hindu gods and their godmen\". The co-director Khan began looking for shooting locations in July 2012. Second unit filming was set to begin in late 2012, which was stalled after the rumoured departure of three department heads for the film and bad weather stalling initial shoots. Hirani denied rumours that the film would be delayed, stating that principal filming had always been intended to begin in mid-January 2013 in Delhi and Rajasthan to \"capture the winter of Delhi\".\n Records Shooting officially began on 1 February 2013, with the filming scheduled to occur over a 45-day period. A one-week schedule of shooting of PK was in June 2013 in Bruges, Belgium. A 26-day schedule of shooting of PK started in Delhi from 27 September 2013.\n Awards and nominations The film was marketed by a Mumbai Based company named Spice PR owned by Prabhat Choudhary.\n Sequel The makers released a teaser trailer on 23 October 2014. It achieved 3.4\u00a0million views on YouTube within five days, subsequently receiving 12 million views. It was regarded as the most viewed movie trailers on YouTube. The teaser was attached with the film Happy New Year .\n Controversies In August, the makers found a new promotional strategy to interact with the audiences by introducing talking standees. This was the first time a Bollywood film used a talking standee at varied locations as a part of its promotions. The standee had Khan talking to people in a prominent places in popular theatres and multiplexes.\n See also On 7 December 2014, Khan began the city tour for promotions with Patna. The character he plays speaks in Bhojpuri which is the main language used for communication in Bihar. Aamir said at the event \"I have decided to launch the promotional campaign of my film PK from Bihar to connect with the language. My character speaks Bhojpuri in the film.\" Hence, the actor decided to start his promotional schedule from Bihar. Although he wanted to visit Bhojpur, which is 60 kilometers from Bihar, he could not because of security issues. In Bihar he visited a litti chokha stall. The visit resulted in a surge of customers to the shop, and the shop owner put up pictures of Khan eating the local delicacy. Then the crew proceeded to Varanasi where they had a screening of their film 3 Idiots and interacted with the people. Khan made an impromptu visit to Krishana Paan shop to savor a Banarasi pan. The actor specially removed time from his schedule to visit this place. He enjoyed a \"mitha banarasi paan\" there. After the crew visited Delhi, Ahemdabad, Raipur, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Indore, Bangalore and other locations in India. Aamir and makers also promoted the film in Dubai.\n Citations Indiagames, a part of Disney India's Interactive business, announced the launch of the official mobile game 'PK' based on the film.

Production The soundtrack was composed by the trio Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. The film was released worldwide on 5 June 2015 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Kapoor, Shah, Chopra and Singh, who portrayed the members of the Mehra family, as well as Akhtar's direction, the film's music, cinematography and costumes, but it received criticism for its running time and climax. Nevertheless, it proved to be a commercial success, having grossed \u20b91.44 billion  on a budget of \u20b9550 million .  Development At the 61st Filmfare Awards, Dil Dhadakne Do received 5 nominations, including Best Supporting Actress , winning Best Supporting Actor .

Casting and characters Kamal Mehra, a billionaire businessman in Delhi owns AyKa, a company on the verge of bankruptcy, and has a troubled relationship with his wife Neelam, daughter Ayesha and son Kabir. Ayesha has a successful travel business in Mumbai, but is unhappy with her marriage to the narcissistic and controlling Manav Sangha who along with his mother Smita hates her family. Unwillingly Kabir takes part in the business, instead dreaming of becoming a pilot. Kamal and Neelam invite their family and friends for a cruise across the Mediterranean Sea to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary.  Filming Their guests include the Sood family. Kamal and Neelam plan Kabir's wedding to the Soods' daughter Noorie, in exchange to her father Lalit investing in AyKa, aiming to prevent bankruptcy. Aboard, Kabir falls in love with ship performer and dancer Farah Ali. Noorie falls for Rana, the son of the Soods' sworn rival Khannas. Ayesha wishes to divorce Manav. Sunny Gill, the son of Kamal's manager Amrish enters aboard. Sunny is a childhood friend of Ayesha and Kabir, and he and Ayesha were in love as teenagers. However, Kamal had paid for and arranged Sunny's Yale University scholarship to separate him from Ayesha. Ayesha and Sunny, now a successful journalist, still harbor feelings for each other. Unlike Manav, Sunny appreciates Ayesha's strong personality and is a feminist.  Soundtrack Neelam sees Kamal flirting with a local guest and wonders why she did not divorce him despite his past infidelities. Ayesha confronts Sunny about their separation and kisses him, which shocks them both. Farah hears that Kabir is going to marry Noorie and storms off. Kamal sees Noorie making out with Rana and learns that Kabir and Noorie are not together as he had thought, causing him to have a gas attack.  Release Kabir reveals to his family that he is in love with Farah and intends to leave the family business. He asks them to consider Ayesha, who is actually interested in business. When he tries to persuade them to let her proceed with her divorce, Kamal and Neelam refuse, believing marriages are lifelong commitments. Infuriated, Kabir bursts out that they are hypocrites for talking of marriage, values, and morals, as the whole family circle is aware of Kamal's adultery and that Neelam has been suffering silently for years. Kamal asks Neelam why she had not left him; she reveals she had no choice because her family would not accept her back due to dishonour. Kamal realises his mistake and asks for Neelam's forgiveness. While trying to reconcile Manav and Ayesha, Kamal sees how his son-in-law mistreats his daughter and orders him and Smita to leave, finally agreeing to the divorce and apologizing to his daughter.  Reception Farah is dismissed from her job for being romantically involved with a passenger and told to leave the ship. Kabir learns about her dismissal after the ship has set sail. He breaks news of Ayesha's now-impending divorce to Sunny, and after publicly rejecting his impending marriage to Noorie, jumps off the ship to swim to shore, believing his family will rescue him. Kamal, Neelam, Ayesha scramble aboard a lifeboat and go after him with the help of their friends. While leaving, Ayesha asks Sunny if he will wait for her, to which he replies \"forever\". The family rescues Kabir and head toward shore to help him find Farah while being chased by the ship's crew. The Mehra family is seen happy in each other's presence for the first time.  Box office The cast is listed below: Accolades When Excel Entertainment announced its upcoming films in March 2012, one of them was Zoya Akhtar's next film following Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara . It was reported that she was working on a script and that filming was due to start in December 2012. Akhtar dismissed the reports, saying she was yet to start writing her next script. In May that year, media reports suggested Akhtar was already writing her next film. That July, it was reported the script was about siblings partially based on Akhtar and her brother Farhan Akhtar. Farhan Akhtar later denied reports of the film being autobiographical, saying it had nothing to do with their real life relationship and that it is entirely a work of fiction. In November 2012, Akhtar said she was still writing the script and that the film was a family drama. References Akhtar co-wrote the screenplay with her long-time friend and collaborator Reema Kagti. Akhtar had always aspired to make a family drama with a brother-sister relationship at its core. She felt such topics not been well represented in Indian films, and that the brother-sister relationship bond has always been shown \"wrapped in rituals\" and never portrayed as it really is. She believed the theme of brother-sister relationships \"generally have cheesy representations. They are never at ease. This is one of the most important relationships in the world because nobody else shares your parents. I wanted to show that relationship in Dil Dhadakne Do.\" Akhtar also wanted to showcase the quirkiness of a dysfunctional family, with different layers to each family member, saying, \"the beauty of families lies in their flaws\".

As he drives, he narrates the story of his college days.\n Casting Past: Chakaravarthi's father, Ganesan, is a strict father who cares a lot about Chakaravarthi's studies and wants him to be a civil engineer. But Chakaravarthi hates studying and lies to his father about his test marks. At the same time, Chakaravarthi falls in love with Angu, Angaiyarkanni, alias Angu, during his 12th year of school. Initially, she avoids him but soon reciprocates his feelings, but they end up going their separate ways after Ganesan and Angu's father confront about their relationship since Chakaravarthi claims Angu is just his friend to avoid his father bashing him up.\n Filming Chakaravarthi joins BEC  in Coimbatore. However, the college's disciplinarian professor, Bhoominathan, whom the students fear and hate, ruins his expectations of enjoying college life. Chakaravarthi constructs a plan to send Bhoominathan away to be a visiting professor at St. Paul's University in Russia so that students can be happy. Meanwhile, Chakaravarthi meets Angu again, who is also a part of BEC. Angu befriends Lilly, a first-year student, despite his attempts to woo her. Lilly explains to Chakravarthi that, after the incident in their school days, Angu's father stopped talking to her.\n Post-production Chakaravarthi successfully patches them up after creating a short film and ends it on an emotional note that Angu's father and Angu reconcile. Angu is impressed and reciprocates his feelings. Amidst this, Bhoominathan unexpectedly returns from Russia and discovers that Chakaravarthi sent him there. In revenge, his assistant clicks a photo of Chakaravarthi and Angu at the Taj Mahal. He uses it to complain to Killivallavan, the BEC chairman. Chakaravarthi, in return, presents a picture of Bhoominathan with Miss Swetha at the Taj Mahal. It gains the wrath of Killivallavan, who is disappointed about Bhoominathan.\n Music Meanwhile, Ganesan discovers the truth about Chakaravarthi, including his college test scores. Feeling cheated and enraged, he slaps Chakaravarthi. Chakaravarthi decides to venture into filmmaking by attending a short film competition. However, Ganesan does not allow him to do filmmaking and wants him to do engineering. Chakaravarthi secretly films portions of the college with cameraman Perusu. At the film's climax, Bhoominathan finds out about his secret filming. In a muddle of guns, drama, and confusion, Bhoominathan suffers an accident that severely injures his neck, but Bhoominathan eventually survives. The chairman of BEC dismisses Chakravarthi from the college.\n Release Ganesan discovers Chakaravarthi's secret filmmaking and destroys his short film, resulting in an intense confrontation between them. Frustrated with his father, he leaves the house. Bhoominathan gradually recovers while Chakaravarthi prepares another short film for the competition. Bhoominathan and Chakaravarthi develop a positive rapport. Bhoominathan tells Chakravarthi that he spoke with the chairman. He informs Chakaravarthi that if he clears all of his arrears, he can get his engineering degree, thus burying the hatchet and ending their conflict.\n Theatrical Chakaravarthi's short film gets shortlisted to the top and becomes a feature film, which enters the 100 Crore Club. The film 'Untold Love' is about Chakaravarthi's emotional bond with Ganesan. He realises Ganesan really cared for him before he died. Chakaravarthi later marries Angu. \n Distribution Present: Chakaravarthi was desperate to get an engineering education from Bhoominathan; that was the only reason to attend college. He accepts and takes his degree. Chakravarthi then delivers an emotional speech to the students and audience. He also sees a vision of Ganesan applauding. Chakaravarthi gets added to the Proud Alumni list at BEC, which was something he asked Bhoominathan in his earlier college days.\n Marketing In August 2017, Sivakarthikeyan was reported to collaborate with his friend Vignesh Shivan, post Suriya's Thaanaa Serndha Koottam, with the film's producer K.
