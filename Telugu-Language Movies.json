The film is the fourth installment of the Gangster series.\n Cast The storyline of Satya 2 is narrated by a voice about the underworld whose activities have slowed down from the last decade in Mumbai . The story is based on Satya who comes to Mumbai and starts working for Lahoti, a construction magnate. In trying to beat a competitor in a deal, he gets involved with the mafia and other underworld elements who don't have the clout anymore. Later, he kills RK who is the retired mafia leader and his son since his son wanted to kill Satya due to a feud between them.

He makes enemies all around and in a shootout with cops, loses his girlfriend and also his friend. But, even though he is captured, he is able to get out of jail through the company he creates with his connections and begins his reign as the newest underworld leader in Mumbai/Hyderabad.\n Telugu version \"As a film maker I have been doing a deep study of the underworld and its gangsters for more than two decades primarily for the purposes of gathering subject matters for my films and to get inspired for characters from real life references..And that's how films like Satya and company happened... Then one day it occurred to me what if a guy out there studied the same gangsters not for becoming a film maker but for the purpose of becoming a gangster himself.it's that idea of mine which finally shaped itself into Satya 2. A new age gangster will obviously be armed with the mistakes of the earlier gangsters and also with the modern day policing methods\". said Ram Gopal Varma. One romantic song of Satya 2 was shot in Kashmir in June 2013. The Central Board of Film Certification  passed Satya 2 with A certificate with 3 cuts.

The film stars Chiranjeevi in lead role alongside Nayanthara, Salman Khan and Satya Dev. It is produced by R. B. Choudary and N. V. Prasad on Konidela Production Company and Super Good Films' banners. In the film, the supreme leader of the ruling party dies, leaving a huge vacuum, not only in the electoral and leadership sphere of the party but also that of the state. In the inevitable succession squabble the thin line that separates good and bad becomes irrecoverably blurred. Who will succeed him forms the plot.\n Cast Principal photography commenced in August 2021 with filming taking place in Hyderabad, Ooty and Mumbai. The music is composed by Thaman S with cinematography handled by Nirav Shah. Godfather was released theatrically on 5 October 2022 and opened to positive reviews from critics. With gross of over \u20b9108 Crores against a budget of \u20b9100 crores, it failed at the box office, becoming the third consecutive box office failure of Chiranjeevi's career after Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy and Acharya.\n Production At Interpol's office in France, an officer is handing over his case about Abraham Qureshi who is a mysterious smuggler kingpin and godfather to his junior, stating that it was his only unsolvable case.\n Development Meanwhile, in Andhra Pradesh, CM Padmakant Reddy alias \"PKR\", the leader of the ruling party Jan Jagruti Party , dies in the hospital while getting treated. Taking advantage of the situation and believing that it would benefit the upcoming election, acting CM Narayana Varma sends party workers to riot outside the hospital. Govardhan, a truth-seeker, records a YouTube live stream and condemns those who praise PKR, claiming that he was a puppet, during his final years in the hands of a financial syndicate, which controls the entire Indian political system. He claims that the JJP party has twice the amount of money than the entire state's treasury, and the person who replaces PKR is crucial. He lists four possible candidates during the live stream: Sathyapriya, Jaidev Das, Varma, and Brahma Teja.\n Casting Sathya is PKR's daughter married to Jaidev, a notorious and discreet drug dealer, who mainly deals with real estate and Hawala scams. He is also in contact with drug lords in Mumbai, all unknown to Sathya. Varma declares himself as the most likely successor to PKR due to his seniority in the party and particularly for his lobbying skills. Brahma, meanwhile, is PKR's first child but was kept a secret from the world, as PKR did not want the public to know that he had a son with his first wife. Govardhan describes him as the \"most dangerous\" person from the list and addresses him as Godfather. Brahma's past is unknown but is now known for his contract work for corporations in Chennai, all known from Govardhan's research. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Jaidev and Varma meet the former's partner, Abdul, and tell him that PKR had given him an ultimatum, a month ago, to stop his immoral activities. With PKR's demise, Jaidev plans to fund the JJP with drug money, by offering money to the present financier. With the help of Abdul, Jaidev cuts a deal with Lukas, who agrees to transfer \u20b9750 crore , every month, in exchange for importing unchecked drug contraband into Hyderabad, once the JJP wins the election. For the deal to proceed, Jaidev has to first set up a discreet drug factory. Abdul insists that the factory should be on a government-sealed roadside. At the same time, the last rites of PKR are carried out in Hyderabad, where Sathya asks Varma to forbid Brahma from taking part in the ceremony. On Varma's orders, Indrajeet attempts to hinder his way but fails. That same night, Jaidev arrives home, where he gives some malana cream to Sathya's sister Jhanvi and convenes a meeting with the JJP ministers, informing his decision to fund the party and dissolve the current ministry, which will ensure the preponement of the elections.

She grows up listening to the poetry of her father and is later inspired by the writings of Ravi Shankar , a Naxal leader who uses the pen name Aranya. Vennela becomes obsessed with Ravi's works, therefore admiring and loving him.\n Development In 1992, the state police probes her village under suspicion that the villagers are sympathetic to the Naxals. They thrash Vennela's father severely as he objects to their actions. Vennela scolds the police in retaliation but they harass her. Ravi's troop arrives and ambushes the police. Ravi assures the safety of the villagers, impressing Vennela.\n Casting Vennela calls off the wedding with her cousin by telling him that she is deeply in love with Ravi, much to the dismay of her parents. She leaves her house the following day in pursuit of Ravi and writes to her parents not to search for her. Vennela meets Vidyadhar Rao in Karimnagar who publishes Ravi's books.

Vennela promises to deliver her letter to him and bring him back.\n Filming Vennela continues her search and learns that she can find Ravi at the Bhupalpally degree college. However, Vennela is frisked by the police who suspect her to be a Naxal sympathizer. The police bring her to the college to confirm her identity, only to engage in a shootout with Ravi's troop. Unable to meet him there, Vennela reaches out to Shakuntala, a human rights activist, and confesses her love for Ravi. Shakuntala arranges Vennela's meeting with Ravi but Ravi politely declines her proposal by saying he doesn't believe in love.\n Soundtrack Meanwhile, the police arrive at that place and surround the building. Vennela helps to set up the explosives so that Ravi's troop can escape, however, she gets caught by the police. Ravi rescues her later that night and shelters her at Shakuntala's home.

That night, Sammaiah kills 11 members of Ravi's troop by launching an assault on them and escapes. Sammaiah publicly claims that the Naxal movement has lost its ideals, therefore, it is infiltrated by his coverts who would work for the police.\n Theatrical Police send a false message from the party to Ravi which instructions him to weed out the covert in his troop. Raghu who was always wary of Vennela tells that she is the covert as she was Sammaiah's recruit. Bharatakka seconds him by proving that Vennela entered their troop using a string of lies.

Raghu and Bharatakka rush to Ravi and tell him that the message was fake. Distressed Ravi retrieves Vennela's body from the waters and sobs in grief, as do others.\n Reception In June 2018, Venu Udugula stated that his second directorial venture would be a period love story set in the backdrop of the 1990s, and it would be a \"commercial entertainer\" focusing on politics and action, apart from being centered on romance. Sai Pallavi and Rana Daggubati were signed to play the lead roles in November 2018. The film was launched in June 2019 in Hyderabad.\n Critical reception The film is set during the Naxal movement which happened in Telangana in the 1990s. Udugula wrote the story from the events he witnessed from his childhood in Warangal.  Pallavi's character Vennela is based on Thumu Sarala, a 16-year-old girl from Warangal district. Sarala quit her studies in 1992 and enrolled herself in the Peoples War Group to join the naxalites in their cause. However, Sarala was killed by the naxals a month later under mysterious circumstances. Udugula felt the need to bring this story onto the screen, depicting the incident and the politics behind it. The plot, however, follows a fictional storyline and characters written by Udugula. Following the film's release, Pallavi, Daggubati and Udugula met Sarala's family to express their condolenses.\n Box office The film is titled Virata Parvam, based on the fourth book of the Indian epic Mahabharata. The film is not related to the epic but Udugula stated that it shares several elements from that episode. \u201cAs my film has elements such as politics, conspiracy, love, vendetta and positivity, we felt that it would be an apt title,\u201d Udugula added.\n Notes Daggubati is cast in the role of Dr Ravi Shankar alias Comrade Ravanna. For his role, Daggubati reduced his weight in order to look lean for the film. Gopichand was Udugula's first choice for the lead before Daggubati was finalised.\n References In May 2019, Priyamani was cast as Comrade Bharathakka, a Naxalite, and documentary filmmaker Sai Chand was also appeared for a supporting role in the very same month. Tabu was initially cast in the film, but due to schedule conflicts she was subsequently replaced by Nandita Das in August 2019. The film marked Nandita Das' return to Telugu cinema, whose last appearance in a Telugu film was Kamli . Naveen Chandra, Zareena Wahab and Easwari Rao, and are cast in supporting roles. Actress Nivetha Pethuraj is signed to play a crucial role in the film.\n External links"

Both of them are brought in and interrogated without knowledge of the other's presence. CI Nagendra, who shares an old rivalry with Siddharth, tortures him.

Ghibran\u2019s soundtrack adds some drama but ultimately, Amigos ends up as an interesting idea that does not take off.\" Paul Nicodemus of The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Overall, Nandamuri Kalyan Ram\u2019s acting prowess and presence, with a touch of action and comedy, make this action thriller work in parts. His portal of Bipin stands out. It\u2019s not a perfect film, but it has enough to keep the viewer engaged.\"\n References 123Telugu gave 2.75 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Amigos works to an extent and highly benefits from the excellent performance of Kalyan Ram. Ashika, Brahmaji, and others justified their roles. The film actually had more scope but it wasn\u2019t utilized to the full extent. The film has a decent second half and a below-par first half.\"\nLatha Srinivasan of India Today gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"At the outset, the storyline is interesting and, seeing the success of playing dual roles in Bimbisara, Kalyan Ram has gone the extra mile and played a triple role in this Amigos. Director Rajendra Reddy has tried to give all three men \u2013 Manju, Michael and Siddhu \u2013 different characterisations, but he has succeeded the most only with Michael, who has come scope for performance.\"\n External links"

When questioned by the Indian Army Officials on why he did it and that the area belongs to Pakistan, he replies \"It is ours\". Young Sandeep grows up with his sister, Sandhya, and his parents K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi, in Yelahanka, Bangalore. As a child, he was very curious about the world around him. When Unnikrishnan took him to see a Navy ceremony with military airplanes flying in the sky Sandeep developed an early fascination with the life of a soldier. In his later years as a secondary school student, Sandeep falls in love with his classmate, Isha.

His colleagues subsequently use tear gas and Sandeep races up to the 5th floor. He ultimately rescues Pramoda and Shirley and heroically kills some of the terrorists. However, when his CO asks him whether he needs reinforcement or not, he refuses. His last words are \"Do not come up, I will handle them.\" But as fate would have it, he is killed in action, laying down his life for his country. Major Sandeep's parents watch in horror as the news coverage shows that Sandeep was killed in action.

When the girl students laugh at the picture of a male organ, the lecturer gives a new definition of manliness.\" Another reviewer from IndiaGlitz stated \"The 'magathanam' reference is integral to the story of the film. Many are of the view that the film is going to spark a change in the way masculinity is projected in Telugu movies. A number of Netizens have felt that toxic masculinity will give way to healthy masculinity in our movies now that 'Uppena' is on its way to becoming a blockbuster.\"\n Accolades Director Buchi Babu Sana in an interview to The Indian Express said \u2013 \"We might not talk about it or put it across in as many words, but casteism is an intrinsic part of our lives. You can see it in the way people interact with others who are from a different caste. The whole idea of Uppena is to drive home the point that love is beyond all these boundaries of casteism and class.\"\n Remake Priyanka Kanoj of International Business Times asked about film's story being similar to 2016 Marathi film Sairat, to which Tej replied \u2013 \"Sairat is one of the most amazing movies I've watched. The actors, the establishment of roles, etc can be termed as brilliance. I would definitely not draw any comparison between Sairat and Uppena. Of course, there are a number of movies with the same storyline, dealing with love and honor killing. But, the audience will definitely know that Uppena is a genuine story.\"\n Notes Uppena was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on 2 April 2020, on the occasion of Rama Navami.

Nagar.

Portions of Ready were shot at Film City in Mumbai and Cherish Studios at Madh Island in the north of Mumbai.\n Overseas The final schedule of shooting started in February 2011 in Bangkok.

Two songs from Ready, \"Character Dheela\" and \"Dhinka Chika\", which were filmed in Bangkok were re-shot in Mumbai's Film City studios.

Advance bookings were opened on 29 May  in several multiplexes. It became the first Indian film to release on at least 1000 UFO digital prints and almost 1900 prints in all. The advance at single screens matched that of Dabangg and even bettered it at places. The world premiere took place at Grand Cineplex, Dubai on 1 June 2011.\n Awards and nominations The film received mixed reviews from critics. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave it three stars out of five saying, \"The film is an unabashed ode to Salman Khan, the entertainer rather than the actor. And yes, it works at that level.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama awarded the movie four out of five saying, \"On the whole, Ready is strictly for the masses and for those who relish typically formulaic masala entertainers. The film prides itself with super music , gags and gimmicks aplenty and of course, Salman Khan, the beloved of the masses and the mainstay of this film.\" Filmfare also awarded four stars out of five, while commenting, \"When it comes to a Salman Khan or a Rajnikant film, their performance is not important. It's the audience performance that counts.\" Komal Nahta of Koimoi.com gave it a rating of three and a half stars and stated, \"Ready will score at the box-office, thanks to a great start, super-hit music, Salman Khan and entertainment in a good dose.\"\n Soundtrack Anupama Chopra of NDTV Movies awarded two stars while commenting, \"Thankfully, Ready isn't in the same soul-sucking category as director Anees Bazmee's last two movies: Thank You and No Problem. But it still falls very much into his special brand of brain-dead, anything-for-a-laugh comedy.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com awarded the film one and a half stars saying, \"Ready doesn't even try to make sense and therefore falls flat.....only it's more extortionate than value for money.\" Sonia Chopra of Sify awarded two and a half stars while commenting, \"The film is unabashedly Salman-centric. He's doing it all: the wise-cracks, gregarious dancing, beating the bad guys, and romancing the girl. All this with his characteristic drawl and swagger.\" Kunal Guha of Yahoo! Movies gave the movie one star and stated, \"...the movie refuses to end, as unnecessary confusions and complications pile up and you wonder if there's enough reel left to clear it all up.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN awarded the movie one and a half stars out of five, commenting \"'Ready' is strictly for die-hard Salman Khan fans  who're willing to forgive the fact that this tasteless, senseless film has no plot to speak of, yet lazily unfolds over two hours and thirty minutes... Salman Khan deserves better than this.\" Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express gave the film one star and said \"What really kills this film is that its nonsense is neither inventive nor high energy.\"\n Reception Khaleej Times awarded the film three stars commenting, \"Bazmi's script, a shoot off of a Telugu hit, accommodates more characters than Goa during the tourist season. Every character is over-dressed and over-the-top.\" Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times gave two stars stating, \"Salman's re-grounded masala  is still novel for the time being. He walks into Gaiety to briefly say hi to his audiences... It's a pop-cultural experience all right, and fully worth it.\" Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid-Day rated it with two and a half stars saying, \"The best thing about the movie, of course is Salman Khan. His fans will not be disappointed and yes, they will get to see him topless in the climax.\" Shalini Saksena of The Pioneer gave the film six out of ten saying, \"Believe it or not but Salman Khan is on a roll. After the success of films like Wanted and Dabangg, he is ready with Ready which has his stamp all over it... Though there is nothing spectacular about the storyline, it manages to make you laugh.\" Preeti Arora from Rediff gave a score of two out of five and said \"Ready isn't a tribute to Salman Khan. It's a vehicle which showcases the 'Best of Salman' one has seen over the last twenty years. It entertains in bits.\"\n See also In India, Ready opened to an overwhelming response at the box office and packed cinema halls with single screens reporting nearly 95%\u2013100% occupancy, while multiplexes reported 60% to 100% occupancy, depending on session times.
