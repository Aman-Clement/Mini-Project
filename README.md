# üçøMini-Project - Movie Spoiler Detection and Scaling System
This project aims to use AI, machine learning, deep learning, and web scraping to develop a system that rates spoilers on a scale of 1 to 10 for movies and TV shows from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The purpose is to provide viewers with a more personalized and efficient viewing experience by allowing them to make more informed decisions about what to watch and what to avoid. The system also uses a recommendation system to suggest movies and TV shows based on the viewer's preferences. The project addresses challenges such as collecting data from streaming services and developing a spoiler scale that accurately represents the impact of spoilers on the viewing experience.
