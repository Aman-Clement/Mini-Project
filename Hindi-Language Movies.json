    "plot": "\n Plot Ek Villain Returns  is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film written and directed by Mohit Suri. It is a sequel to his 2014 film Ek Villain. The film stars John Abraham, Arjun Kapoor, Disha Patani and Tara Sutaria.\n Cast The film was released theatrically on 29 July 2022 and opened to mixed reviews from critics and performed badly at the box office.\n Production A masked intruder barges into an apartment complex, where he attacks and kills a singer named Aarvi Malhotra. The cops, headed by ex-CBI officer and DCP Aditya Rathore, deduce that the attack was orchestrated by Gautam Mehra, who is the son of businessman Divesh Mehra, and arrest him.\n Casting Flashback: Gautam is a spoilt brat, who is berated by Divesh for having created a commotion at his ex-girlfriend Siya's wedding. The commotion video has been made into a rap song by singer Aarvi. Gautam is ousted from the business and his house. Pretending to be in love with her, he helps her scare away her rival Q/Kiran. Aarvi falls for Gautam and reveals that her biological father Balkrishnan Shastri, a popular singer, had an extramarital affair with her mother, but never accepted either of them. Her main goal is to make her father accept her as his daughter by becoming a famous singer and then reject him. Gautam leaks Aarvi's childhood photos, implying that he was out to get even with her for humiliating him, and Shastri publicly rejects his daughter. Aarvi is heartbroken. Three months after the breakup, when Gautam gets attacked by Siya's husband Aditya, and Aarvi takes care of him, he realizes his love for her. He pleads with her to give him a second chance, but Aarvi leaves him, albeit with a heavy heart. \n Filming Present: Gautam escapes from the cops. Ganesan surmises that Gautam hasn't killed Aarvi. The cops interrogate Bhairav Purohit, whom Aarvi had called from her phone, the day she was murdered, but he denies committing the crime and there is no evidence either. Ganesan determines a pattern, that the killer only targets young girls with one-sided lovers, after discovering that 18 girls have been murdered with a similar modus operandi in the past 6 months. The ensuing circumstances motivate Ganesan to conclude that Gautam is not the serial killer, and it is later revealed that the serial killer is, in fact, Bhairav; Gautam fights him but is unable to see his face, which allows Bhairav to escape.  \n Soundtrack Flashback: Bhairav is a cab driver who works part-time as a zookeeper along with his widower friend Keshav, who has a son Yash, but ignores him for random girls he brings to the zoo. He meets Rasika Mapuskar, a retail salesgirl at a mall, falls deeply in love with her, and harbors plans for marriage. One day, Rasika injures a group of rogues that were eve-teasing her, which reveals her dark side to Bhairav. The day Bhairav decides to propose to Rasika, he witnesses her getting intimate with her married manager Atul, and is heartbroken. Rasika subsequently instigates him to kill girls who don't reciprocate the feelings of their respective boyfriends. Bhairav is mentally tormented and starts murdering dozens of girls. On the day Aarvi leaves Gautam, she turns out to be traveling in Bhairav's cab; Bhairav misunderstands that she has dumped Gautam, and attacks her.\n Reception Present: Gautam learns about Bhairav's zoo address and leaves to confront him. Ganesan is killed by Bhairav, who reveals that Aarvi is alive. She tries to escape the zoo where she had been kept by Bhairav but he catches her and locks her in an underground cage. Just as Gautam and Bhairav are about to fight, the police come and detain Bhairav. They interrogate Yash, who frames Keshav in an attempt to defend Bhairav. The police also investigate the crime scene, where a girl's dead body is found inside the freezer, though it is not Aarvi. \n Box office Outside the station, Gautam sees Bhairav and Rasika hugging. Later that evening, both return to the zoo and attend to Aarvi's cage; Aarvi regains consciousness and stabs Bhairav with a glass shard that she found there. Rasika bursts into laughter while Bhairav attacks Aarvi. Gautam arrives to save her, and a fight ensues between the guys. Bhairav hits Gautam, who falls to the ground, and demands Rasika's reaction, but at this point, Gautam begins laughing and asks who and where \"Rasika\" is: in a shocking twist, it turns out that Bhairav was hallucinating her all along. Bhairav then reminisces that Rasika told him how Atul was planning to ditch his family for her; he had, in fact, inadvertently killed Rasika by cracking her back while begging her not to leave him. The body the cops found in the freezer is revealed to be Rasika's, which Bhairav kept for himself. He drops to the ground in dismay while Gautam and Aarvi reconcile. Realizing his mistake, Bhairav walks inside the cage of the tiger only to meet the same fate as his victims. Aarvi can be seen singing at her concert with the support of her fans and Gautam.\n Critical response During a mid-credits scene, at a mental asylum, Rakesh Mahadkar, who has survived the accident and became paraplegic meets Bhairav, who has lost an eye due to the tiger attack. Rakesh recites his promise from the prequel and Bhairav wakes up just before the screen cuts to black.\n Release Aditya Roy Kapur was originally signed for the role portrayed by Arjun Kapoor, but later backed out due to creative differences with director Mohit Suri. Then, Kartik Aaryan was approached but he could not accept the offer due to date clashes with his Dhamaka.\n Theatrical Principal photography began on 1 March 2021. Abraham finished shooting in October 2021. The entire film was wrapped up on 24 March 2022.\n Home media The songs are composed by Ankit Tiwari, Tanishk Bagchi, and Kaushik-Guddu. The lyrics are written by Manoj Muntashir,  Kunaal Vermaa, Tanishk Bagchi and Prince Dubey.

It became the 47th highest-grossing Indian film of all time.\n Production The film begins in the 1960s .\n Filming and development Raees, a sharp-minded boy, lives in Fatehpur, Gujarat, a dry state and gets involved in the illegal liquor trade from a young age. He uses his mother's philosophy: no occupation is low and no religion greater than any occupation as a mechanism of self-deception. Along with his best friend, Sadiq, he starts working for a local gangster, Jairaj \u2014 who prefers Raees as he comes up with novel ideas for smuggling. As his power and influence grow, he decides to part ways with Jairaj and takes the help of a crime boss, Musabhai to start his own business. He gains immense popularity in his community: he provides them liquor, employs them for receiving and delivering orders and thus enjoys political support from both the Chief Minister and Pashabhai, the leader of the opposition.\n Release Meanwhile, an honest and powerful police officer, ACP J. A. Majmudar is transferred to Fatehpur and starts a major crackdown on alcohol dealers, focusing on Raees. This affects most of the dealers except him as he manages to smuggle past Majmudar \u2014 leading to hostile relations and a failed assassination attempt by Jairaj. Raees subsequently kills him in retaliation. In the meantime, Raees marries his neighbour Aasiya and has a son with her.\n Box office At the baby shower, he convinces the CM to transfer Majmudar to the Police Control Room and takes on a new real-estate project offered to him. With Majmudar gone and construction in full swing, all seems to be going well for him. Majmudar, however, is still keeping track of his activities through phone taps and moles he planted earlier.\n Domestic Raees publicly assaults Pashabhai over a disagreement and the CM sends him to jail temporarily as a PR stunt. With Raees locked up, the CM and Pasha ally the upcoming local elections. Realizing he has been betrayed, Raees decides to stand in the elections, uses his popularity and wins.\n Overseas Seeing him as an imminent threat, the CM recalls Majmudar back to Fatehpur and declares his real-estate project's plot as protected land \u2014 rendering the construction illegal. Raees incurs huge debt to his community, whom he had convinced to invest in the project. To worsen the situation, communal rioting in the state leads to the imposition of a curfew jeopardizing his liquor business.\n Critical reception Completely broke, a desperate Raees reaches out to Musabhai for help, who offers him money for smuggling in gold by sea. Soon, serial bombings occur across India. Raees becomes aware that Musa used the gold as a cover to smuggle RDX. The police lead a massive cross-country crackdown; all of Raees's associates are either caught or killed. Heartbroken and grieving, Raees kills Musabhai and his men for using him to kill innocents. Subsequently, he surrenders to Majmudar, well aware that he will kill him. Majmudar and Raees deliberate over their time together, following which Majmudar shoots Raees. As he falls, he recalls memories from his life and his mother's teachings. Majmudar drives away, musing about Raees's last words.\n India The shooting of the film began in April 2015.

Raees opened to 3,500 screens worldwide. The film is streaming on Netflix.\n Controversies In March 2016, a legal notice was sent by an alleged gangster, Abdul Latif's son, Mustak, asking why a film on his father's life was being made.\n Music A few days after the 2016 Uri terror attack, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena  asked for a ban on films featuring Pakistani actors on the basis that the actors were not openly condemning terrorism. Raees was on their list because cast member Mahira Khan is Pakistani. MNS put forward a condition to lift the ban, that producers shall never cast Pakistani artists in future and they have to give crores as penance to the Indian Army welfare fund, but the Indian Army refused to accept it by saying sacrifices should not be politicised. Later, ban was lifted without the conditions on Raees as demanded by MNS.\n Marketing Farhan Akhtar, co-producer of the film said Raees will never pay, and was threatened by MNS. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra and member of the BJP and the RSS, Devendra Fadnavis said at the meeting with MNS and the producers \u20b95 crore as contribution to the Indian Army welfare fund was not quoted compulsory and was never a condition for lifting ban on films featuring Pakistani actors demanded by MNS, and earlier at an event praised Shah Rukh Khan as an \"icon\" and a \"proud Mumbaikar\".\n Accolades Worldwide, Raees has grossed \u20b9304 crore , making it the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2017 at the time, the highest-grossing January release for a Hindi film since 1994, and one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films of all time.\n Notes Raees grossed \u20b9128\u00a0crore worldwide in its opening weekend.

    "plot": "\n Plot Kabir Singh is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film written and directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and jointly produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar under T-Series Films and Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde under Cine1 Studios. A remake of Vanga's own Telugu film Arjun Reddy , it stars Shahid Kapoor in the titular role as a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend, Preeti, played by Kiara Advani, marries someone else. Adil Hussain, Nikita Dutta, Arjan Bajwa, Suresh Oberoi, Dolly Minhas, Suparna Marwah, Anurag Arora, Soham Majumdar, Kunal Thakur, Anusha Sampath, Amit Sharma and Kamini Kaushal feature in supporting roles.\n Cast Principal photography for Kabir Singh began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews with criticism directed at it glamorising misogyny and toxic masculinity, though Kapoor's performance and the soundtrack, which has become popular since release, received acclaim.  Grossing over \u20b9370 crore, it became the third highest grossing Bollywood film of 2019, and Kapoor's highest grossing solo-lead release. It became the 26th highest grossing Indian film of all time.\n Production Kabir Rajdheer Singh, a house surgeon at the Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences, suffers from severe anger management problems that gain him the reputation of a bully. After a brawl, Kabir is told to either apologize or leave, but chooses to stays upon catching sight of a new student, Preeti Sikka.\n Development Later, Kabir and his friends announce to the student body that Kabir has exclusively claimed Preeti. Initially timid, she adjusts to his overbearing attitude and eventually reciprocates his feelings, developing an intimate relationship with him. Kabir graduates with an MBBS degree and moves to Mussoorie for post-graduation. Despite the distance, their relationship strengthens over the next few years. After Preeti graduates, she introduces Kabir to her conservative parents, but her father Harpal catches them kissing and throws Kabir out.\n Writing Harpal continues to oppose their relationship, despite Kabir's attempts to explain their love. Enraged, Kabir demands that Preeti choose between him and her family within the next six hours, or he will end their relationship. Preeti fails to reach back to him in time; feeling abandoned, Kabir injects himself with morphine and remains unconscious for the next two days. Upon gaining consciousness, he learns that Preeti is being forced into an arranged marriage and gatecrashes the wedding party; Harpal has him beaten and arrested. After Kabir is released, his father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family for his antics.\n Casting With his friend Shiva\u2019s help, Kabir finds a rented flat and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he abuses drugs and alcohol, attempts one-night stands, has casual relationships, and names his new pet dog Preeti \u2014 none of which are successful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a high-functioning alcoholic both respected and feared by the hospital staff. His self-destructive behaviour and obsession worry his friends.\n Filming While hungover on a day-off, Kabir is called in to perform an emergency surgery for which he unwillingly agrees. During the procedure, he collapses from dehydration. Suspicious, the hospital staff takes his blood samples, which contain traces of alcohol and cocaine. A case is filed against him and during an in-house hearing, a broken Kabir admits to alcoholism and violation of medical ethics. As a result, his medical license is suspended for five years and he is evicted from his flat. The next morning, he learns of his grandmother\u2019s death; at the funeral, he and his father reconcile. Kabir also resolves to quit his habits.\n Soundtrack Some days later, Kabir spots a pregnant but dejected Preeti sitting in a park. He approaches and offers to raise the child with her if she is unhappy in her marriage. Initially silent, she bursts into angry tears, berates him for discarding her, and ordering him to leave. Shiva then describes Kabir's obsession and self-destructive habits, which she was unaware of. Shocked, she confesses that she left her husband three days after the marriage and has been working in a clinic to support herself. Overcome with anger, especially after hearing about his casual affairs, she had refused to contact him. She reveals that her marriage was never consummated and that the child is Kabir\u2019s. They marry and reunite with their families, with Harpal apologizing to them and the families coming together. The film ends with them on their honeymoon, on a beach, with their baby.\n Marketing After the success of his debut, the 2017 Telugu film Arjun Reddy, writer and director Sandeep Reddy Vanga wanted to remake it in Hindi with Ranveer Singh. When it did not work out, he approached Shahid Kapoor. However, producers Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde of Cine1 Studios, who acquired the remake rights for Hindi, wanted Arjun Kapoor to play the male lead. Disappointed, Vanga said, \"I've come to know that the remake rights of Arjun Reddy have been sold and it would star Arjun Kapoor. I am caught in a dilemma, as I've already locked Shahid for the role. It's a very embarrassing situation for me. I don't know how I'll face Shahid.\" In April 2018, however, it was officially announced that Shahid Kapoor would star, with Vanga returning as director.\n Release Bhushan and Krishan Kumar of T-Series also produced the film. The dialogue was written by Siddharth\u2013Garima. Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran was selected as the cinematographer and Aarif Sheikh as editor. Vanga was confident that the remake would be even more hard-hitting than the original: \"When I made Arjun Reddy, I wasn't sure where to draw the line in terms of representation of certain things. I don't think I'd have to restrict myself when it comes to the Hindi version. I believe I'll have more freedom in Bollywood.\" The film's title Kabir Singh was announced on 25 October 2018.\n Reception Like the Telugu original, Kabir Singh too begins with a voiceover from the hero's paternal grandmother, but this time she is reciting a Kabir Doha. There are also geographical changes; the remake is set primarily in Delhi and Mumbai. Instead of caste conflict as in Arjun Reddy, the heroine's father takes offence to Kabir's smoking and not being a turban-wearing Sikh. For the remake, Vanga said he deployed less English than the original. \"I've also tried to retain the colloquial quality in the Hindi dialogue.\" About the name Kabir Singh, he said, \"There's a lot of melancholy in the name Kabir and a poetic side too.\" Vanga explained his reasons for choosing this as the film's title: \"When we started work on the Hindi script, it was a very exciting journey. Kabir Singh, as the protagonist's name, came naturally, considering the character's graph. Kabir Singh has the same punch and madness of Arjun Reddy.\"\n Critical response Shahid Kapoor portrays the title character, Kabir Rajdheer Singh. Although Kiara Advani was Vanga's first choice for the female lead character Preeti, things failed to materialise. Tara Sutaria was then announced, but left when a delay in the production of her debut film Student of the Year 2  caused scheduling conflicts. The makers then went back to Advani to play the role of Preeti, Vanga cited her performance in M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story  as one of the reasons. According to Vanga, \"Kiara epitomises the female character in the film to the T. She has the perfect combination of innocence  and maturity  that's so important for the character\". Arjan Bajwa was initially uninterested in playing Kabir's elder brother Karan Singh, but accepted at the insistence of Vanga, for whom he was the only choice to play the character. Amit Sharma, who appeared as Amit in the Telugu original, was chosen to reprise his role.\n Box office The makers considered beginning the shoot in August, but it was delayed to September as Vanga wanted Kapoor to grow his beard more for the role. Principal photography eventually began on 21 October 2018 at Mumbai, four days before the announcement of the title. Filming also took place at Delhi and Mussoorie. Kapoor dons three different looks for the film. Regarding this he said, \"There's a certain mind space and the present which the character is in and there's also the past which he has been part of. Along with this, there's the culmination. So, there are three distinct energies that the film needs.\" He went through substantial workouts to portray Kabir in two time periods; to achieve the character's \"college boy\" look, he shed 14 kilos of weight, and for the \"puffy, groggy alcoholic\" look, he worked out in a way that he would look \"bigger but not muscular\". Principal photography wrapped on 29 March 2019.\n Home media The soundtrack is composed by Mithoon, Amaal Mallik, Vishal Mishra, Sachet\u2013Parampara  and Akhil Sachdeva with lyrics written by Irshad Kamil, Manoj Muntashir, Kumaar and Mithoon. Harshavardhan Rameshwar composed the score. The song \"Bekhayali\" was popular even before its release, with several cover versions available on YouTube.\n Awards and nominations In a first-of-its-kind marketing deal, Kabir Singh became the first Bollywood film to have its very own theatre. As many as 15 PVR theatres in 15 cities across India would be renamed as \"Kabir Singh Ka Theatre\", with auditoriums reflecting the characteristics of the title character played by Kapoor.\n References Kabir Singh was released on 21 June 2019, worldwide on 3616 screens including 3123 screens in India. It is distributed by AA Films within India. Khetani chose not to release the film in Pakistan, following the 2019 Pulwama attack. The film received an 'A'  certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification  with the CBFC asking the makers to modify a scene where a character is seen snorting drugs, and also asked for insertion of static warning messages against drug abuse in all such scenes.\n External links"

Cast In the fictional Middle Eastern city of Al-Barkat, Ankit Sethi is the owner of a diamond insurance company who owes a huge debt as the company's workers had misplaced a client's diamonds worth \u20b920 crores. He meets Neha Grover, a flight attendant, on a flight and is instantly attracted to her. They later go out on a date and Neha starts liking him as well. They begin a relationship and sometime later, Neha announces that she is pregnant. Ankit proposes to marry her and she accepts. They both are attacked by a pair of goons working for the client to whom Ankit owes the debt. Neha is severely injured, which leads to her miscarriage. Seeing no other way to pay back the huge debt, they both decide to pull off a robbery. Minister, Harish Sanyal would be smuggling diamonds from Al-Barkat to India by plane, which would be carried by a courier appointed by him and Ankit would accompany him. A cellphone with its back cover laced with the diamonds would be kept inside a briefcase which would be locked by a code number. Ankit strikes a deal with Sanyal's secretary to reveal the code number to him and in return he would give him half the diamonds. Once on the flight, Ankit and Neha put their plan on motion - Neha deliberately spills food on the courier's clothes while serving the passengers, and he heads to the washroom to clean up the mess. Seizing the opportunity, Ankit goes to retrieve the diamonds from the briefcase, but just then a group of masked terrorists arrive, announcing that they have hijacked the flight, and hold all the passengers hostage.  Release The hijackers order the pilots to land the plane on Kullu and demand that Adil-Mir, a terrorist who is held up in a prison in Manali, be released immediately. Ankit pretends to be suffering from asthma and requests the hijackers to allow him to get his inhaler from the other compartment, so that he can secretly steal the diamonds. But before he can steal the diamonds, one of the hijackers senses that he is lying, and beats him up. When government officials contact the hijackers, they head towards the cockpit to talk to them on the telephone and Ankit again sneaks into the other compartment to steal the diamonds. He takes out the diamonds from the briefcase and puts them in his own bag. Just then, one of the hijackers arrives and discovers the diamonds. Before he can shoot Ankit, he knocks the gun out of his hand and they both engage in a brutal fist fight. The other hijackers also arrive and together beat Ankit and lock him up in the washroom. Just then, a man named Sudhanshu Roy, who claims to be the Flight Marshal, picks up the gun dropped by one of the hijackers, and shoots all of them down, supposedly killing them. The passengers are safely evacuated from the plane.  Music The hijackers had attached a bomb to Ankit's body and the bomb squad arrive to diffuse it, but the bomb turns out to be fake. Moreover, the dead bodies of the hijackers are not found on the plane and Sudhanshu is found to be is missing as well. It is revealed that the real Flight Marshall is Bhanu Yadav, who was unconscious throughout the flight, and that Sudhanshu was an impersonator. RAW officer Parvez Shaikh arrives with his team to investigate the matter and interrogates all the passengers. Bhanu reveals that he was served a glass of orange juice on the flight, and that he may have fallen unconscious after drinking it. Ankit finds out that the diamonds stolen by him are fake. It is revealed that Ankit had pretended to be in love with Neha so that he can receive her help in pulling off the robbery on the flight.  Reception It is also revealed that Neha had discovered the truth that Ankit was only using her for his own benefit. She had contacted her old accomplice, Sudhanshu, and they had together hatched the plan to carry out a fake hijacking of the flight and steal the diamonds themselves, to take revenge on Ankit. They had brought together a team including Jinu, Nikki and Abbas, who would board the flight posing as passengers and later wear masks and act as the hijackers, and Gaffar, who would make artificial guns for them. Neha would spike the drink of Bhanu, making him fall unconscious, and Sudhanshu, pretending to be the Flight Marshal, would replace the diamonds with fake ones, pretend to kill the hijackers by firing a blank bullet, and escape, while the hijackers would blend in with the passengers after removing their masks.  References Neha makes an anonymous phone call to Sanyal and pressures him to order Parvez to stop the investigation and cover up the matter, or else she would bring out the truth of him smuggling diamonds. The case is closed and it is brought in front of the media and the general public that there had indeed been a hijacking and Bhanu is hailed as a national hero for killing the hijackers. Neha forwards a text message to Sanyal's phone, which shows that Ankit had received the code number to the briefcase on his phone. Realizing that he had tried to steal the diamonds, Sanyal brutally tortures Ankit. Neha comes to visit Ankit at the hospital, where he is recovering from his injuries, and reveals all the truth to him, saying that her revenge is complete. Sometime later, Neha receives a phone call from Ankit, hinting that he is also planning to take revenge on her.  External links"

Khan explained, \"When Harry Met Sally... is one of the greatest love stories ever made in the history of world cinema. Our film on the other hand, is quite original, a fun space love story by Imtiaz Ali. But it is a takeoff from there as that movie is a classic. It is a way to attribute.\"\n Notes In an interview with The Indian Express, Khan discussed about the possible epilogue of the movie; the couple had three children and moved to a small town for some time. Sejal then works as a lawyer while Harry takes time off and writes a book. The former takes the role of a working partner while the latter looks after the children.\n References Filming began in late August 2016 in Prague and continued in Amsterdam & Budapest from September 2016.

    "plot": "\n Plot Jersey is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language sports drama film written and directed by Gowtam Tinnanuri, being his Hindi directorial debut and the remake of his 2019 Telugu film of the same title. Cricket action was choreographed and directed by Rob Miller of ReelSports. It stars Shahid Kapoor as a former cricketer who returns to the game for his son's wish of buying a Jersey T- Shirt, alongside Mrunal Thakur and Pankaj Kapoor. The film is produced by Geetha Arts, Dil Raju Production, Sithara Entertainments and Brat Films.\n Cast Official announcement for the film was made in October 2019. Principal photography commenced in Chandigarh in December 2019 and ended in December 2020, amidst delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Jersey was originally scheduled for a cinema release on 28 August 2020 but was postponed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was theatrically released on 22 April 2022. Despite a positive reception from the critics and praise for Shahid Kapoor's performance, Jersey performed poorly at the box office.\n Production 26-year-old Arjun Talwar  is an extraordinary cricketer from Chandigarh with the highest batting average in all of India and 106 half-centuries, fifty-two centuries, nine double centuries and two triple centuries to his name. Following the 1985-86 Duleep Trophy finals, Arjun awaits news of his selection in the India national team, only to find out his inclusion in the list was a misprint. Following this, he quits cricket. Arjun then applies for a job in the food sector and shortly after marries his girlfriend Vidya , with whom he has a son named Ketan, nicknamed Kittu . However, sometime in the early 1990s, Arjun is suspended from his job on corruption charges, although he is innocent.\n Music In 1996, Arjun lives with Vidya and Kittu in a dilapidated house in Chandigarh, with Vidya struggling to make ends meet as a hotel receptionist. Kittu loves playing cricket, much like Arjun did, and wishes to get a jersey of the Indian national team for his upcoming birthday. Arjun tries getting one, but finds out it is very expensive; he then tries to loan the Jersey in vain and Vidya refuses to lend him money for the same. His friends try pooling funds for the jersey, but fall very short of the budget. Arjun's former coach Baali Sir  approaches him to inform him of an upcoming charity match between Punjab and New Zealand, with players' fees included. Arjun's friend lies that Arjun has agreed to  play, forcing Arjun to practice for the match late at night.\n Release The next day, the New Zealand team bats impressively and sets a high target for Punjab. At first, Punjab seems to be losing the match, with very few runs and wickets falling quick. Arjun is sent onto the pitch, hitting fours and sixes with ease. Although the Punjab team eventually loses the match by one run, Arjun is praised by many, especially Kittu, for his exceptional batting. However, he is dismayed to find out that players' fees are going to charity as well. Arjun, ashamed that he was unable to get his son a jersey, tells Baali Sir that he wants to get back up playing cricket.\n Home media Officials are skeptical about Arjun, a 36-year-old, playing cricket, thinking he will not do well and will quit again in a year or two. However, they then see him play during practice, amazed by how he is able to score easily. Selections for the upcoming Ranji Trophy are underway, with only 15 out of 30 of the trainees being selected. The results come in, and Arjun is ecstatic after finding out that his name in the list. The first few matches go well, with Arjun making centuries effortlessly and simultaneously earning his teammates' respect and teaching them some of his techniques. Meanwhile, Arjun's time on the field takes a toll on him, resulting in him having to go to the hospital for some tests. Although it is said he may not be able to play in the finals, Arjun nevertheless appears for the match against Karnataka at the Wankhede Stadium.\n Distribution In the second half of the match, he is pitted against Gowda, a bowler from the Karnataka team who has effortlessly taken wickets of batsmen who had played prior in the match. Gowda proves to be a challenge to Arjun, who however manages to get to a century. Gowda tries many tricks to take Arjun's wicket. However, this does not deter Arjun from scoring. In the final over, the team barely manages to score runs due to the opposition's strong bowling and Arjun being on the non-striker end. On the final ball, Arjun needing three runs to win, attempts to hit a sixer. Despite risking being run out, Arjun manages to make the required runs for his team to win the match and the trophy.\n Reception In 2022, Jasleen Shergill, a journalist who supported Arjun during his comeback, writes a biography about him titled Jersey. At a function relating to the book, it is revealed that recently, a list of players selected for the Indian national team headed to England was found, with Arjun's name included in it. A grown-up Ketan is then called upon stage to receive a jersey with Arjun's name on it, thus fulfilling his childhood dream of getting a jersey. Ketan reveals that shortly after the Ranji finals, Arjun had to be admitted to the hospital, succumbing to heart failure caused by arrythmia, something Arjun knew he had, but chose to keep it a secret and the reason why he had to quit cricket. Ketan then ends his speech by stating that while people believed his father lost his life while trying, it was the opposite; even during hardships, Arjun never backed down till the very end.\n Box office Speculations for a remake of the Telugu film Jersey  began soon after its release. Later it was reported that Shahid Kapoor has been roped in to star as the lead actor while Shraddha Kapoor was considered for the female lead. In August 2019, Kannada actress Rashmika Mandanna was considered to play the female lead in this film and it will be her Hindi debut film.

But later Mrunal Thakur was finalised to cast in the movie Shahid's father Pankaj Kapur was roped in to portray Coach Murthy. The principal photography commenced on 14 December 2019 in Chandigarh.\n Critical response While filming in January 2020, it was reported that Shahid Kapoor received thirteen stitches during a scene, though he later recovered.

Ranbir Kapoor features in a dance song.\n Cast Chillar Party won the 2011 National Film Award for Best Children's Film.\n Soundtrack Eight innocent but feisty kids lead carefree lives in Chandan Nagar, a colony in Mumbai, where each has his own identity and a nickname based on these qualities. Not only that, but their whole team has a nickname that has earned them significant notoriety. They explain that they have mainly two enemies - the 'oversized' neighbouring cricket team to whom they always lose, and a dog they named \"Loose Motion\" since she dirties their cricket pitch, so they develop an enmity against dogs. Their hopes are shattered shortly after a boy, Fatka, who was employed for washing the cars of the society, enters with his dog Bhidu. They do everything to throw the boy and his dog out, but become unsuccessful. Eventually they develop a friendship with each other as Fatka helps them by serving as the lead bowler during the match with the neighbouring cricket team. During this time, they also start interacting with a young girl who moves in, and an unemployed youngster who becomes successful after Fatka helps him out. But their happiness is short-lived when a reckless politician, welfare minister Shashikant Bhide, enters their life after his personal secretary Dubey is attacked by Bhidu for hurting Fatka.\n Track listing Bhide announces in a news telecast that all the stray dogs roaming about in residential buildings in Mumbai will be caught and terminated, misleading audiences with a concern for public safety. He further informs that the dog can only be saved if the society files a No Objection Certificate within 1 month. The kids, shocked by this, strive hard to get the NOC, wherein they have to get at least more than 50% votes of the total residents in the society i.e. 31 votes. But they manage only 10 votes after 15 days.\n Reception With more efforts gone in vain, the kids finally organize a march across the streets purely in underwears. This gains them enough traction to pull 10 more votes. With more hard work and awareness they manage to get another 10 votes counting a total of 30 votes. With only a day left for the deadline as declared by Bhide, they approach secretary L.N. Tandon, who is close to Bhide and has resented the kids all this while. Whilst all this chaos is going on, a TV channel invites Bhide and the kids for face-off. Seeing this as their last chance, they attend the interview which is being telecast across India. Knowing that that is the last day and dog catchers are after Bhidu, they pray hard to save him. During the interview they are constantly mocked by Bhide who questions their education and upbringing, but it soon takes a turn and culminates in the kids answering Bhide back with their moral education responses. Having won, the kids plead to leave after a moving speech by Fatka, and the interviewers agree. When they reach the society, they are disheartened as there is no sight of Bhidu. Suddenly, Bhidu comes jumping in, wearing a collar reading \"Bhidu- Chandan Nagar Society\". While they are happy seeing Baidu, they realize Tandon changed his mind after the face-off; he too is happy and seen cheering for them.\n Critical reception The music was composed by Amit Trivedi, while the lyrics were penned by Tiwari with Bahl, Trivedi and Amitabh Bhattacharya as guest lyricists.\n Box office Chillar Party received mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and said \u2013 \"On the whole, Chillar Party is not just for kids, but for grownups as well. A story of grit and determination, it works not just as an entertainer, but also advocates a message rather strongly. A film that deserves to be tax-exempted so that it reaches out to a wider audience. A small film with a gigantic spirit... Encourage this one!\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated it with 3 out of 5 stars and said \u2013 \"Through the entire first half, the writer-director duo holds the proceedings at a level that is completely in sync with the unpretentious spirit of the film. In the run-up to the climax, however, the film comes precariously close to tying itself up in knots as the child-like aura it builds up begins to teeter on the edge of childishness. Mercifully, it stays on its feet and doesn't topple over. For that alone the film deserves at least three stars.\" Zee News gave the film 4 stars and wrote, \"Chiller Party may be a small film. But as cinema goes, in its adroitness, it is much more mature than 99 percent of the films ever made in India. And that, you`ll reckon, is no `small` achievement.\" Sonia Chopra of Sify awarded it 4 stars saying, \"Storytelling by co-directors-writers-lyricists Vikas Bahl and Nitesh Tiwari is first-rate. They make you deeply connect with the characters\". Shivesh Kumar of IndiaWeekly awarded the movie 3 out of 5 stars. Preeti Arora of Rediff gave it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \u2013 \"Chillar Party is an enjoyable film with plenty of laughs. Do watch this, unless of course you hate kids.\" Vandana Krishnan from Behindwoods gave the film 3 out of 5 stars describing the film as \"fun filled one that is sure to leave you with a smile and moist eyes. Humor, emotions, and siddhartha is my best friend entertainment and values- You can't ask for more.\" Oneindia.in gave 3 stars while commenting \"On the whole, Chillar Party is not just for kids, but grownups also will enjoy the film equally. A story of great determination presented in an entertaining way is what makes Chillar Party a good watch.\n Accolades Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India gave Chillar Party 2 out of 5 stars and said \u2013 \"Filmmakers need to realize Indian teens are extremely smart and are fed on a regular diet of Cartoon Network and roller-coaster Hollywood kiddie's flicks. You got to have a story, adventure drama and pace.\" Soumil Shukla of FilmiTadka rated it with 2.5 out of five stars and wrote in his review \u2013 \"despite its shortcomings, Chillar Party succeeds in overcoming a lot of deformations forced by the \u2018formula\u2019 philosophy on this genre of films. If not for anything else, watch it to enjoy the delightful performances from the young actors who are the real heroes of this film.\"\n References Chillar Party grossed \u20b9630 million  in India.

    "plot": "Brothers is a 2009 American psychological drama war film directed by Jim Sheridan and written by David Benioff. A remake of the 2004 Danish film, it follows Captain Sam Cahill , a presumed-dead prisoner of the War in Afghanistan who deals with extreme PTSD while reintegrating into society following his release from captivity. The film also stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Cahill's brother and Natalie Portman as his wife. Both films take inspiration from Homer's epic poem the Odyssey.\n Plot The film received a mixed response and grossed $43 million. Maguire, however, received particular praise for his performance, receiving a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama.\n Cast In October 2007, United States Marine Corps captain Sam Cahill is about to embark on his fourth combat deployment to Afghanistan. He is married to his high school sweetheart Grace, and together they raise two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie. Sam's brother, Tommy, is a convicted felon who is released from prison on parole a few days before Sam\u2019s deployment. At a family dinner with Tommy and Sam's parents, Hank and Elsie, Maggie reveals to Tommy that Grace dislikes him, and Hank insults Tommy for his lack of success compared to Sam.\n Reception During Sam's tour, his Blackhawk helicopter is shot down in Helmand Province. Sam and private Joe Willis are the sole survivors and are taken prisoner by Taliban fighters. Sam and Joe are declared killed in action by the U.S. government. At Sam's funeral, Hank attempts to drive Elsie and the girls home while drunk, but Tommy stops him. Hank again berates Tommy; and Tommy blames Hank for influencing Sam to join the Marines because of his own Vietnam War service.\n Box office Tommy attempts to redeem himself and completes a kitchen remodel for Grace. Hank and Tommy also mend their relationship, and Grace bonds with Tommy, aided by his growing paternal connection with Isabelle and Maggie. Grace and Tommy share a fireside kiss, but do not take their attraction any further. However, Tommy continues to remain close with the family and his nieces grow attached to him. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are tortured by their captors and Sam is eventually forced to beat Joe to death.\n Critical response Sometime later, Sam is rescued by American forces and returns home, where he struggles to readjust, showing signs of severe post-traumatic stress disorder; his daughters grow fearful and resentful toward him. Sam also lies to Joe's widow about her husband's death. His paranoia also causes him to believe Grace and Tommy fell in love while he was gone, causing him to remain aloof. During Maggie's birthday party, Isabelle is rude to her sister and jealously complains that Maggie got what she wanted for her birthday, while Isabelle did not. Isabelle scolds Sam for being in Afghanistan during her birthday, but being able to attend Maggie\u2019s. Isabelle then begins to play with a balloon loudly, despite objections from Sam and Grace, until Sam snaps and pops the balloon out of fury.  Already scared and resentful of Sam's erratic behavior and violent mood swings, an angry and hurt Isabelle falsely claims that Tommy and Grace are having an affair and tells Sam that she wishes he had actually died. Returning home, believing his daughter\u2019s story, Sam becomes enraged, and proceeds to destroy the kitchen with a crowbar while screaming at Grace. When Tommy suddenly shows up, he attempts to bring Sam into an embrace, trying to calm his brother's violent breakdown, while Grace isolates her daughters from their father. However, Sam immediately becomes defensive when he realizes that Tommy has called the police.\n Accolades The police arrive and enter a standoff with Sam, who fires his  gun into the air and demands that the police kill him, before holding the gun to his own head, contemplating killing himself. He reluctantly surrenders after several pleas from Tommy and Grace. He is arrested and admitted to a Department of Veterans' Affairs mental hospital. Grace visits, giving him an ultimatum that if he does not tell her what happened, he will lose her forever. Sam finally confides in her that he killed Joe and they embrace. In narration, he wonders if he will ever be able to live a normal life again.\n Home media On its opening weekend, the film opened #3 with $9,527,848 behind New Moon and The Blind Side. Since its box office debut the film has grossed $43,318,349 worldwide.\n Opera adaptation Brothers received mixed reviews from film critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 159 reviews, with an average score of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It plays more like a traditional melodrama than the Susanne Bier film that inspired it, but Jim Sheridan's Brothers benefits from rock-solid performances by its three leads.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 31 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n References Tobey Maguire received critical acclaim for his dramatic performance; Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars and wrote that Brothers is \"Tobey Maguire's film to dominate, and I've never seen these dark depths in him before.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today observed the resemblance between Maguire and Gyllenhaal, and praised their onscreen chemistry. Regarding Portman's performance, Puig opined that it was \"subdued and reactive\". Writing for New York magazine, David Edelstein praised the three main actors: \"Sheridan's actors work with their intellects fully engaged\u2014and they engage us on levels we barely knew we had.\" He also complimented the cinematography and Sheridan's ability to pull the reader into the plot. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman gave the film a rating of C+, writing, \"Brothers isn't badly acted, but as directed by the increasingly impersonal Jim Sheridan, it\u2019s lumbering and heavy-handed, a film that piles on overwrought dramatic twists until it begins to creak under the weight of its presumed significance.\"\n External links"

    "plot": "\n Plot Cirkus is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language period comedy film directed and produced by Rohit Shetty. The film is jointly produced by Rohit Shetty Productionz and T-Series. The film stars Ranveer Singh and Varun Sharma in dual roles alongside Pooja Hegde and Jacqueline Fernandez. In the film, two sets of identical twins mixed up at birth encounter each other as adults.\n Cast Cirkus is the fifth installment of Golmaal franchise, a spin-off to 2017 film Golmaal Again and remake of the 1982 Hindi film Angoor which itself was based on William Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors. Principal photography for the film began in November 2020 at Mumbai and also took place in Ooty.\n Production Cirkus was released theatrically on 23rd December 2022. The film was panned by critics and became a huge commercial failure\n Music In 1944, Dr. Roy Jamnadas , who is working on the theory of nature vs nurture, separates two sets of identical twins he finds at the doorstep of the orphanage he runs and gives them up for adoption to two different families, based in two different cities. One pair is given to a couple in Ooty and the other pair to a couple in Bangalore, and both the couples name them Roy and Joy, after Dr. Roy and his own adoptive brother Joy. Roy 1  and Joy 1 's father runs a circus and after his death, they both take up the responsibility of running the circus. Roy 2 and Joy 2's father is a rich industrialist. Roy 1 has a strange connection with electricity and electric currents do not affect him. He uses this ability to show tricks at the circus and becomes famously known as 'Electric Man'. Elsewhere, Roy 2 receives electric shocks whenever Roy 1 comes into contact with electricity.\n Release The story then moves forward 30 years. Roy 1's wife, Mala , cannot conceive and wishes to adopt a child from the Jamnadas Orphanage, but Roy 1 is against the idea. Roy 2 is in love with Bindu but her father Rai Bahadur is sceptical about him as he had seen Roy 1 with Mala in Ooty and had mistaken him for Roy 2, thinking that he is cheating on Bindu. Roy 2 and Joy 2 come to Ooty to buy a tea estate and there is a lot of confusion and misunderstanding as people mistake them for the other pair of twins. Three robbers - Momo, Mango and Chikki are after them to rob their money. They back off when Roy 2 gives them electric shocks and their boss, Polson Dada later comes to take revenge. They also come across Nagmani, the shady cab driver and Bagheera, the dacoit turned hotel owner. Roy 2 thinks they are all part of a huge criminal gang who want to rob them, and when they happen to come across Mala, they think that she is the leader of the gang.\n Theatrical Roy 1 decides to gift a diamond necklace to Mala but the jeweler mistakenly gives it to Roy 2, creating further confusion. Moreover, Bindu's father is now convinced that Roy 2 is married to Mala. On hearing this, Bindu threatens to end her relationship with him, not knowing that Mala is actually Roy 1's wife. All the confusion is cleared when both the pairs of twins come face to face at the circus and Dr. Jamnadas reveals the truth to them and his real intention behind separating them.

It follows the titular character Mili Naudiyal, who gets stuck in a freezer and fights to stay alive.\n Cast Principal photography took place from August to November 2021 in Mumbai and Dehradun. The film's music was composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. It was distributed by Zee Studios and released theatrically on 4 November 2022. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pahwa's performance. This film was a box office bomb\n Production Mili Naudiyal is a B.Sc Nursing graduate and attends IELTS coaching classes intended for a job abroad. She works part-time at a restaurant named Doon's Kitchen, located within a plush mall. She lives with her father Niranjan Naudiyal, who does not like her going to Canada and has disagreements with Mili. Unknown to Niranjan, Mili has a boyfriend Sameer Kumar, who is in search of a job.\n Soundtrack One night, while Sameer is riding Mili to her home, they are stopped by police who penalise him for not wearing a helmet and drunken driving, they both are brought to the police station. Niranjan is summoned to the station, and is in dismay of seeing his daughter and does not talk to her despite her several attempts of creating conversation. The next night after work at Doon's Kitchen, Mili's manager Sudheer Malkoti unknowingly locks her in the freezer room. At -18\u00a0\u00b0C, Mili has to survive in the freezing cold and tries everything to keep herself alive. She tries to block the exhaust fan but ended up dislocating her leg. She starts to get frostbite and bleeding through her nose.\n Release and reception Niranjan starts getting worried that Mili has not reached home. He searches for Mili with the help of his neighbour. They call all her co-workers but they all say they do not know anything. Sameer, who was on his way to Delhi half-heartedly, returns and also joins the investigation. They go to the police station to file a complaint but they are greeted by an SI Satish Rawat, whom they met the day before. He suspects Sameer. Niranjan tries to defend him and this causes a feud between Rawat and the search party. He deliberately tries not to help them by not sharing the last tower location of Mili he got from Cyber cell. They get a clue that Mili might have had a problem with the auto drivers in front of the mall. They all reach there to enquire. The auto driver whom they suspect denies the allegation.\n Home media At this point, they meet a watchman of the mall who says that Mili might not have left the mall because he usually notices her going in and out. They open the freezer after five hours and find Mili. She is taken to the hospital just before she had the last stage of hypothermia. Then Niranjan enquires with the watchman about how was he sure that Mili did not leave the mall. The watchman says Mili smiles at him every time she comes in and out of the mall. He did not see her go out on the day of her missing. Mili reunites with her father and Sameer. The doctor says that she is out of danger and she needs physiotherapy later. He continues that its difficult for any common man or woman to survive that cold weather and Mili is a brave girl. Meanwhile, Malkhoti is warned by a police officer that he must install an alarm in the freezer or else he will face consequences. When the watchman asks Niranjan what his daughter's name is, Niranjan proudly replies, \"Mili\".\n References In August 2020, Boney Kapoor bought the rights to remake the Malayalam film Helen  in Hindi. The title of the remake, Mili, was announced a year later. Mathukutty Xavier, the director of the original, was retained for the remake too. He recalled in 2021 that he had refused an offer to remake Helen in Hindi, but when contacted by Kapoor who wanted his daughter Janhvi to star in a potential remake, agreed. Noble Babu Thomas who portrayed a lead character in Helen, served as the remake's creative director. Ritesh Shah was hired as the screenwriter to help adapt the script to suit Hindi-speaking audiences. Ranjith Ambady, the makeup artist from the original, was retained in the same position.\n External links"

In September 2017, Reliance Entertainment joined the film's producers and officially announced the biopic with members of the winning team, where Singh and Khan brought on board. Following an extensive casting and pre-production process, the film began principal photography on 5 June 2019, where it was majorly shot in and around England for three months and a brief schedule took place in India, before filming being wrapped up on 7 October.\n Production Earlier locked for cinema release in April 2020, the film was pushed from its release date several times due to the casting and pre-production works that delayed filming, and also due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, thus resulting the film to be delayed entirely till 2021.

During the second innings when India is fielding, Madan Lal bowls toward Viv Richards who is on strike. Richards lofts the ball in the air for a six but results in getting caught out by Kapil Dev.\n Casting The film then shifts to 30 May 1983 at the BCCI office in Mumbai where the BCCI officials get an invitation to the Cricket World Cup. Sunil Gavaskar is dropped from captaincy and Kapil Dev is made the captain. The cricketers who are in the squad namely Dev, Mohinder Amarnath, Kirti Azad, Madan Lal, and Sunil Valson are already there in England playing County Cricket.\n Pre-production Along with the team manager PR Man Singh, the rest of the team which includes Gavaskar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Syed Kirmani, Sandeep Patil, Dilip Vengsarkar, Yashpal Sharma, Roger Binny, Ravi Shastri and Balwinder Singh Sandhu reach London where they witness the West Indies Cricket Team the two-time World Cup winners, being hounded by photographers at the airport. After they reach the hotel they join the rest of their teammates.\n Filming The team fails horribly during the four warm-up matches which leads to doubts being raised about the performance of the Indian team in the Group Stage of the World Cup itself. During the press conference, Dev confidently tells the reporters that his team is here to win. During a training session of the West Indies team, the Indian team witnesses their four deadly fast bowlers namely Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall, and Joel Garner who were known for delivering deadly bouncers to the batsmen. At the ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the Queen wishes the teams luck and the teams proceed for a group photograph. On the way back to their hotel on the bus, Dev gives an inspirational speech during the team meeting in accentuated English.\n Music The World Cup starts with India being placed in Group B alongside the strong teams Australia and West Indies.

India unexpectedly win their first match against West Indies by 34 runs at Old Trafford, Manchester with Yashpal Sharma being the Player of the Match for his contribution of 89 runs . \n Marketing The teammates later celebrate at a bar that night. They also manage to win their next match against Zimbabwe by 5 wickets at Grace Road, Leicester thereby leading to the rise in the expectations of the Indian fans. Patil scores a half-century and Madan Lal is named as the Player of the Match. \n Release However, the team becomes over-confident and loses their next match against Australia by a huge margin of 162 runs. Dev is disappointed with the team's performance, especially with Roger's performance, and Gavaskar is unable to play due to his leg injury.\n Theatrical With Gavaskar's absence, the following match with West Indies turns out to be a brutal one as in the first innings, Viv Richards thrashes out the Indian bowlers severely thereby making a score of 119 runs off 146 deliveries. The second innings seems to be more violent when Malcolm Marshall bowls deadly bouncers to the Indian batsmen and one of the bouncers hits Dilip Vengsarkar on his chin, injuring him. Mohinder Amarnath puts up a score of 80 runs by bravely facing the bouncers but India lose the match by 66 runs. \n Screenings The morale of the team is shattered. It is further shattered as Vengsarkar is ruled out from remaining World Cup matches due to his injury which resulted in seven stitches. The disheartened team in the bus is stuck on the route because of the West Indies crowd celebrating and blocking the way. However, they see a young Indian boy waving a homemade Indian flag which moves the team to tears and raises their spirits.\n Statistics The next match against Zimbabwe on 18 June at Trent Bridge, Nottingham is a do-or-die one as India will be eliminated from the tournament if they lose. The wives of the cricketers also turn up to show their support as it is thought to be their last match. Gavaskar is back in the team recovering from his injury. India opens up with a shaky start, making 9 runs at the cost of 4 wickets. Dev steps in a hurry onto the field without the helmet as he was taking a shower. While walking to the pitch he sees the disheartened Indian crowd. He then starts scoring runs but the wickets keep falling. During the lunch break, Dev takes out the Mongoose bat which enables him to hit more powerful shots and gives a better counterattack to the bowlers. He then starts hitting boundaries continuously. Dev then makes a world record of 175 runs  and is received with a standing ovation from the crowd and the umpire. India makes a score of 266 runs which Zimbabwe fail to achieve which leads to India winning the match by 31 runs and also retaining their place in the tournament.\n Controversies A party is held by the High Commissioner in which all the team members show up except for Binny who does not turn up because he is disappointed by Dev constantly chiding him for his bowling performance during net practice. At the party, Srikkanth jokes around and humorously tells the crowd that Dev had gone mad because he told them that they would beat the West Indies which is the strongest team in the cricketing world, but then he says that he has faith in his captain and he would only go home with winning the World Cup.\n Worldwide distribution The final Group Stage Match with Australia at County Ground, Chelmsford on 20 June is an easy win for India as they win by a huge margin of 118 runs with Binny being the Player of the Match for his contribution of taking 4 wickets, praises Captain. India qualifies for the semi-final and this creates a wave of excitement across the country as India managed to qualify for the semi-final for the first time. The Prime Minister Indira Gandhi orders her ministry to ensure that every town and village in the country gets a television service so that the semi-final match can be broadcast. \n Home media and streaming services Before the semi-final, Sandhu is disappointed as his engagement with his fianc\u00e9e Simran has been called off because of his living conditions and low salary. This affects his performance in the semi-final.\n Reception During the semi-final with England, Amarnath and Kirti Azad choke off England's supply of runs by taking wickets. Azad takes the wicket of Ian Botham in which the ball surprisingly spins low towards the ground. England is restricted to a score of 213 all out. In the second inning Amarnath and Sharma build up runs for India, however, Amarnath is run out. During the partnership of Dev and Patil when 4 runs are needed to win, there is a premature invasion on the field by Indian fans. This causes the English captain Bob Willis to set his fielders on the left side so that they can escape if there is another invasion. Patil hits a four and India qualifies for the finals of the 1983 World Cup. Amarnath is named the Player of the Match.\n Critical response This creates further excitement back in India as this win was seemed as unexpected one. On 25 June at Lords, India faces the West Indies again for the final with the latter winning the toss and choosing to bowl. In the beginning, Indian batsmen are restricted severely by the bowlers with Gavaskar getting dismissed for 1 run, but Srikkanth aggressively scores 38 runs making him the highest scorer for the Indian team. However, the team is all out for 183 making it the lowest score in the World Cup final. Dev inspires his team to restrict the West Indies batsmen from scoring runs. \n Box office The team steps onto the field with a rousing reception in the common room. In the second inning, Sandhu takes the wicket of Gordon Greenidge which gives India a lead. However, Richards launches a barrage of boundaries especially when Madan Lal is bowling. Madan Lal asks Dev to let him bowl another over as Richards underestimates him and Dev gives him another over to bowl. He bowls to Richards and Richards lofts in the air for six  but is caught out by Dev. This proves to be the turning point of the match. With Richards dismissed, the wickets of West Indies fall rapidly with Amarnath taking 3 wickets. When West Indies are 9 wickets down, Amarnath bowls to Holding who's the last batsman. Holding misses it and the ball hits his pads. Amarnath and the whole team appeal for the dismissal and Holding is given out leading to India winning the World Cup. The squad rushes towards the dressing room and the jubilant crowd rushes over on the ground and celebrations begin all over the country. A young Sachin Tendulkar back in Mumbai makes a promise that he would play for the Indian cricket team. Amarnath is named Player of the Match and Dev lifts the trophy along with the Indian team.\n Pre sale records As the credits roll, the real Kapil Dev is shown sharing his experience of winning the World Cup along with a montage of vintage photographs of the team.\n India A film based on the 1983 Cricket World Cup and India's win at the tournament was announced on mid-July 2016, with the rights for the production being purchased by Phantom Films \u2014 a joint production company owned by Madhu Mantena, featuring the collaborations of directors Anurag Kashyap, Vikas Bahl and Vikramaditya Motwane. Vishnu Vardhan Induri, the founder and managing director of Celebrity Cricket League, also expressed his interest in co-producing the film, citing his passion for cricket. It is touted to be the first venture of his newly formed production house, Vibri Media. The squad members of the 1983 team, along with former Indian cricketer Kapil Dev met the producers at a suburban hotel in Mumbai, discussing about the film. In the process, the two production companies had signed a Memorandum of understanding  with the 1983 team to make an official biopic, where according to the norms, the producers will get to use the actual names of the players as well as use real incidents from their lives. In an official statement regarding the biopic, Dev stated that \"the journey of the 1983 team is a story of inspiration which proves that one can achieve anything if they aim for it and work for it no matter what the world thinks\".\n Other territories \nDespite the official announcement, the makers were yet to finalise the cast and crew members and the director of the project. Rumours surfaced that Kabir Khan will direct the project and either Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor or Sushant Singh Rajput will play the role of Kapil Dev. When Khan was asked about his role in the biopic, he stated that \"he was fascinated on the story of India's journey at the 1983 Cricket World Cup\" but remained silent on the claims of directing the film. Akshay Kumar was also rumoured to act in the film, which was later declined. On 25 September 2017, Phantom Films announced that Singh would play the role of Kapil Dev, and Kabir Khan too confirmed that he will direct the film. Commercial analysis As a young schoolboy when I watched India win the 1983 Cricket World Cup. I had no idea that from that day onwards cricket in India will change forever. As a filmmaker, for me, the journey to that win, filled with raw energy and sheer passion of that young Indian team, is probably one of the most exciting stories I have worked on. Notes A launch event was hosted at JW Marriott Mumbai on 27 September 2017 by Reliance Entertainment and Vibri Media to announce the biopic officially under the title 83. Singh and the entire former team that won the Cricket World Cup in 1983 were present at the event. Speaking at the event, Khan said that the makers will begin pre-production and location scouting by late-November 2017, and has planned to shoot the film in real locations, in order to create authenticity and also \"to give youngsters to celebrate the milestone in the history of Indian Cricket which happened when many were not even born\".\n References This film was considered to be one of the last productions of Phantom Films, the other being Super 30  and Ghoomketu . The company dissolved in October 2018 after its response to a sexual assault allegation on Bahl by a former women employee of the company, and its collaborators later moved to work on independent projects. Bahl was ousted from the project. In May 2019, Sajid Nadiadwala joined the film as one of the co-producers.\n External links"

After the 2011 blockbuster Singham, Shetty had begun writing the script of the film but left it half-finished. The script of Chennai Express was ready for Khan as a back-up, because of the difficulty of obtaining the actor's filming dates. Upon reading the script, Khan liked the idea and agreed to star in it before the Angoor remake, causing Angoor's remake to be postponed. Shetty said the film is \"a hard-core commercial film with a romantic angle. The story is about this man's travel from Mumbai to Rameshwaram and what happens during the journey.\" About 68 minutes of footage were enhanced with CGI by Reliance MediaWorks.\n Box office Khan was the first actor to be approached with the script and was the first lead actor to be signed for the film. Rohit Shetty stated that despite the title, Khan would not play a South Indian in the film. The casting of the lead heroine was the subject of much press speculation; Kareena Kapoor, Asin and Deepika Padukone were rumoured to be involved. Shetty denied those rumours, stating that the cast would be finalised in April 2012, and that he was going to cast an established actress in the role. In October 2012, it was confirmed that Deepika Padukone had been signed to play the female lead opposite Khan, and photographs showing Padukone and Khan shooting were released. This was Padukone's second film opposite Khan, with whom she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om. Starting with this film, which was released on Women's Day, Khan wished to have the name of his female co-star appear above his own in the credits.\n India Sathyaraj was cast to play the role of Padukone's character's father, making his debut in Bollywood. Actress Priyamani was signed in January 2013 for an item number in the film replacing Nayanthara; both the actresses would eventually go on to star alongside Khan in Jawan. Other personalities from Tamil cinema, including Delhi Ganesh and Mohan Raman, appear in minor roles. The film was initially titled as Ready Steady Po. However, to emphasis on the connection with South India, the film was retitled as Chennai Express with the planned title used as the tagline.\n Overseas Filming on the project began at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai on 5 October 2012. Additional filming was done at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus with a minimal crew. Stills of the lead actor were unofficially released in mid-October 2012. In November 2012, the cast and crew went to Goa to begin filming the scenes set there. Vasco da Gama railway station was used to portray as Kalyan Junction railway station. A romantic scene on board a train passing next to Dudhsagar Falls was also shot. In December 2012, the crew went to Jakarta to film certain scenes. The Pamban Bridge also known as Annai Indira Gandhi Bridge, connecting the town of Mandapam in Tamil Nadu with Pamban Island, and Rameswaram was the scene for the song \"Tera Rastaa Chhodoon Na\".\n Records In January 2013, a shoot was supposedly scheduled to take place in Ooty, but since Khan felt that Ooty was too far from Mumbai, several locations from Ooty were reconstructed on the outskirts of Panchgani in Wai by the art director Narendra Ruharikar. It took over 40 days and \u20b9 15 million to build the required sets. Filming in Wai took the entire month of March 2013. A 10-day shooting schedule in Munnar, Kerala, began in mid-April 2013; scenes were filmed at Devikulam Lake, Meesapulimala, Wagavara and Kannimala. Filming was stopped for several days because of heavy rainfall, resulting in the schedule being slightly extended until end of the same month. A press conference was held in Munnar. In May 2013, scenes were filmed in North Goa. Padukone finished shooting on 25 May 2013. Khan flew to Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad in May 2013 to film his remaining scenes. The film has several Tamil dialogues, but to retain context no subtitles were used.\n Awards and nominations Chennai Express was produced by Gauri Khan, Karim Morani, Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur under the Red Chillies Entertainment banner. It was released internationally by UTV Motion Pictures.\n Game The score of Chennai Express was composed by Amar Mohile; the songs were composed by the duo Vishal\u2013Shekhar, and the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and Yo Yo Honey Singh. Recording of the songs began in late October 2012. The track \"Ready Steady Po\" was recorded in November 2012 by the music's composers. Several sources said that the director and actor were unsatisfied with the score. The director was reportedly asked to plan for a different musical composition. However, the composers denied these rumours. In mid-April 2013, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title track for the film, marking his return to Bollywood for playback after an absence of fifteen years. He said the song celebrated the spirit of togetherness. Initially, Balasubrahmanyam was apprehensive, but chose to sing due to the content and leads of the film. The song \"1 2 3 4 Get On The Dance Floor\" was released as a promotional single on World Music Day. On 27 June 2013, the video promo of the song \"Titli\" was released, and on 11 July 2013, the promo video of \"Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari\" was released.

    "plot": "\n Plot Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India  is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language epic sports drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.\n Cast Produced on a budget of \u20b925 crore , Lagaan was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan's foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of the sports drama Naya Daur  in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar.\n Production Lagaan was theatrically released in India on 15 June 2001, clashing with Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. It received critical acclaim for Gowariker's direction, Khan's performance and the film's anti-imperialist stance. With earnings of \u20b965.97 crore  during its initial release, the film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001. Lagaan was screened at numerous international film festivals and garnered multiple accolades. It was the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India  and Salaam Bombay! . Lagaan became the most-awarded film at the 47th Filmfare Awards with eight wins, including Best Film, Best Director for Gowariker and Best Actor for Khan. At the 49th National Film Awards, the film won eight awards, including Best Popular Film.\n Development The farmers of Champaner village in the Central India Agency depend on monsoon rains for their livelihood. A delayed start to the monsoon has them worried and they head to the ruling British cantonment, to ask the King of Champaner, Puran Singh for an exemption from the year's tax . \n Casting A cricket match is underway between British officers. A young farmer named Bhuvan, provokes them by calling cricket a \"childish game\". Following the match, the local Raja  rejects the farmers' plea, but Andrew Russell, the captain of the British regiment, steps in. He offers a wager in exchange for the farmers playing against his team in a match of cricket. Should they win, he would cancel their tax for the next two years. Bhuvan is made to decide for the village, and agrees when Andrew raises the stakes. \n Pre-production The village elders are nervous at the prospect of losing the game and being required to pay triple the usual tax. Bhuvan refuses to apologise to Andrew or retract his decision, so the match must be played. Andrew's sister, Elizabeth, takes pity on the farmers. She offers to teach them the game in the interest of fairness. Bhuvan starts gathering a team of players for the match. \n Filming An unruly competitor, named Lakha, is part of Bhuvan's team. He has a grudge with him for their common interest in Gauri, daughter of the village medic. He informs Andrew of his sister's actions. Andrew forbids Elizabeth from leaving the cantonment. He is unaware that she has grown attached to the farmers and is also developing romantic feelings for Bhuvan. She continues sneaking out with the aid of local staff, and even attends a village festival. Gauri, who is secretly in love with Bhuvan, starts to grow envious of her.\n Music The match-day dawns and the ground fills with spectators from neighbouring villages. The British team bat first . The farmers must score one run more than the British before the match ends in three days. Smith and Burton begin well, with Smith getting a reprieve due to a Deva no-ball. However, the farmers fight back with Bhura running Smith out and Goli bowling out Burton. Andrew and Brooks bat well and end the day at 182/2. The farmers find out about Lakha's betrayal and he is almost killed, before Bhuvan saves him. Lakha takes a diving catch to dismiss Brooks on the second day.  Their inexperience shows, however, as their batsmen start getting dismissed early on while playing rashly. Bhuvan steadies the innings and takes the match into the third day. On the final morning, the farmers must achieve the score with weak batsmen remaining. Bhuvan plays sensibly, and the match enters the last over. Kachra, the striking player, scores one run off the last ball, but it is not enough to win. The British field umpire signals a no-ball , causing it to be replayed. Bhuvan scores six runs off the next ball and wins the match for the farmers. \n Release Elizabeth rushes to the grounds to find Bhuvan. She is heartbroken when she sees him tightly embracing Gauri, and returns to the cantonment. In the next few weeks, the British Empire orders disbandment of the regiment for the humiliation caused by losing to commoners. The tax collection is cancelled for three years, and Andrew is relocated to Central Africa for his improper management of the Treasury's funds. As her caravan departs, Elizabeth steps out to meet the villagers for the last time. Bhuvan remains unaware of her feelings for him, but thanks her for her help. She bids the villagers farewell and returns to England, choosing to remain unmarried, while Bhuvan marries Gauri in a grand ceremony in the village.\n Home media Lagaan was inspired by Naya Daur , a sports drama film directed by B. R. Chopra, written by Akhtar Mirza and Kamil Rashid, and starring Dilip Kumar, Vyjayanthimala and Ajit Khan.\n Reception Director Gowariker has stated that it was almost impossible to make Lagaan. He went to Khan, who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script. Khan had initially rejected the idea of a \"sporty\" film, but was \"himself in tears\" upon hearing the full dialogued script. Even after securing Khan, Gowariker had trouble finding a producer. Producers who showed interest in the script wanted budget cuts as well as script modifications. Eventually, Khan agreed to Gowariker's suggestion that he would produce the film. Khan corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Gowariker, the story and script of the film, and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce Lagaan. He also said that by being a producer himself, he was able to give greater creative freedom to Gowariker. He cited an example:\n Box office \"If the director tells the producer that he wants 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them.\" Critical reception Jhamu Sughand co-produced the film because he liked the emotional and patriotic story. Lagaan was made on a then-unprecedented budget of \u20b9250 million , the highest for an Indian film of the time.\n Awards Gowariker first thought of having Shah Rukh Khan, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan and Abhishek Bachchan for the role of Bhuvan. After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with J. P. Dutta's Refugee , Khan was approached with the idea.\n See also Several actresses had offered to act in the film, but Khan needed someone who matched the description of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates to accommodate the film, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das, Shamita Shetty and Ameesha Patel were approached for the role, Gowariker selected Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film. Since the script also demanded a British cast, Gowariker and Khan hired Danielle Roffe as one of the casting directors. After Danielle and Gowariker screen-tested many, Shelley and Blackthorne were chosen for the prime roles. Overall, the film cast 15 foreign actors.\n References Raghubir Yadav played the role of the legendary Haji Nasruddin in the teleplay Mullah Nasiruddin and has given many memorable performances such as Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne. Yadav was selected for the role of Bhura, a poultry farmer, based on his performance in Earth . He had undergone an appendectomy operation in-between the filming schedule and returned to complete some of his scenes. Rajesh Vivek, who played the fortune teller Guran, was spotted by Gowariker in the film Junoon . His liking for cricket helped him in his role. Raj Zutshi friendship with Khan and association in several films brought him the role of Ismail the potter after auditions. Pradeep Rawat's association with Khan in Sarfarosh  brought him the role of Deva, a Sikh ex-sepoy, which was initially intended for Mukesh Rishi. Rawat claimed that it was the highest ever compensation he received in his career. Daya Shankar Pandey, who preferred the role of Kachra, was known to Khan and Gowariker through previous films , Baazi  and Ghulam ). Pandey credited Gowariker for his acting in the film as Goli, saying that Gowariker and he would discuss the required emotions and expressions before shooting.\n Further reading Yashpal Sharma was chosen by Gowariker for the role of Lakha, the woodcutter, after his portrayal in Samar . He said it was a good experience working with Khan and Gowariker during the film. Amin Hajee earlier worked in a film with Gowariker. The friendly association brought Gowariker to him with the script, which he liked, and thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role of Bagha, a mute drummer. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped him better prepare for his role. Gowariker, who believed that Amin was like Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming. Aditya Lakhia's association with Gowariker in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa  and Pehla Nasha  brought him the role of Kachra, the untouchable. He read the book Everybody Loves a Good Drought by P. Sainath to better understand and portray his character.\n External links"

Farah conceived the film while directing the musical Bombay Dreams , which was based on the Indian film industry. After Shah Rukh rejected the first version of her next film Happy New Year, she was reminded of Om Shanti Om; the film's title derives from a similar titled popular song from Subhash Ghai's popular film Karz  which starred Rishi Kapoor as the main protagonist. The soundtrack album was composed by Vishal\u2013Shekhar, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. The background score was performed by Sandeep Chowta.

Om often expresses his feelings before Shanti's film poster and desires to meet her.\n Special appearances during the \"Deewangi Deewangi\" song  One night, he sneaks into the premiere of one of her films \"Dreamy Girl\" along with Pappu in disguise. Later that night, a drunk Om gives an emotional speech to Pappu as he dreams of becoming a great actor. Om and Pappu take small acting roles in films which are filmed at R.C. Studios, a major filming compound owned by Mukesh Mehra, a charming but egotistical person who is a wealthy and famous film producer.\n Production While shooting one day, Shanti gets trapped in a fire that grows out of control during filming. Risking his life, Om jumps into the fire and rescues her. Shanti is grateful towards him, and the two become friends. Om lies to Shanti that he is a popular Tamil film actor to impress her. He even puts an act of the filming of his feature, but ultimately tells Shanti the truth of him being a small-time extra upon seeing her genuine fondness for him.\n Development Shanti forgives Om and they spend a happy evening with each other, and she gifts him a snow globe. However, things take a turn when Om accidentally ends up overhearing a heated conversation between Shanti and Mukesh. He is shocked to discover that they have been married for two years but have not revealed it in public as that will ruin both of their careers. Shanti reveals to Mukesh that she is also pregnant with his child, leaving Om heartbroken. He avoids Shanti entirely.\n Casting The next night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of her upcoming film titled Om Shanti Om and tells her that they will cancel its production and instead have a grand marriage ceremony. Om goes to the set to meet Shanti for the last time and return her snow globe but is dejected upon seeing her with Mukesh. He leaves and throws the snow globe in a fountain pond nearby. \n Principal photography Meanwhile, Mukesh tells Shanti that his marriage with Shanti and the unborn child will destroy his successful career. In order to prevent that, he sets fire to the set and locks a horrified Shanti in it, in order to kill her and the unborn child. As he exits the set, Om spots Shanti in the flames and attempts to go and rescue her but is attacked by Mukesh's guards, leaving him severely injured. After they leave, he manages to enter the set but is thrown out of the building by a big explosion. Om staggers on the road as the set burns down with Shanti in it.\n Music Om is left devastated upon witnessing this and suddenly gets hit by the car of renowned actor Rajesh Kapoor. He takes him to a hospital with his pregnant wife Lovely Kapoor who is under labor. The serious injuries of Om result in his death while still reminiscing about Shanti.  Rajesh's assistant Nasser asks his surgeon to keep this a secret from Bela and Pappu. Moments later, Rajesh and Lovely are blessed with a baby boy, and they name him Om Kapoor.\n Release 30 years later, Om Kapoor is shown as a rich young man who is a superstar in Hindi films and is revealed to be the rebirth of Om Prakash Makhija. He experiences Pyrophobia and often comes across Bela who believes him to be her son and tries to take him to her house. An aged Pappu tries to make her understand that he is someone else but she pays no heed to him. Om also ignores her and leaves upon thinking that she has gone crazy. \n Theatrical He and his assistant Anwar Sheikh subsequently drive to the abandoned R.C. Studios for the filming of one of Om's films. Om recognizes the place and experiences some flashbacks of his previous life. He even finds Shanti's broken snow globe and is confused. That night, Om remembers the emotional speech he had given to Pappu in a drunken state when he wins the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. As he gives the same speech to the audience, Pappu watches his award function on TV and realizes that his friend is reborn as Om Kapoor. Meanwhile, a grand party is thrown for Om's success. Om remembers his whole previous life upon being visited by Mukesh, who now works in Hollywood and wishes to make a film with him.\n Screening and statics Later that night, he traces Bela and Pappu to the crawl and has an emotional reunion with them. The three plan to avenge Shanti's death by making Mukesh confess his crime.\n Pre-sale records The next day, Om manages to convince Mukesh to resume the filming of Om Shanti Om at the same ruined R.C. Studios. He auditions several actresses to find Shanti's look-alike but in vain. However, Om ends up coming across Sandhya aka Sandy, a ditzy but lovely girl who is an exact doppelganger of Shanti. He hires her without revealing his plan and ends up firing her as she is unable to act properly. On Pappu's advice, Om reveals his plan to Sandy who promises him that she will help him according to his plan. \n Home media At the inaugural ceremony of the Om Shanti Om set, Bela scares Mukesh in the disguise of an old witch, and Om and Pappu try to light Shanti's photograph on fire to remind him of his crime. Although the setup doesn't work, the photograph is supernaturally lit by fire which disturbs Mukesh and confuses Om and Pappu. Mukesh is more horrified when Sandy appears in front of him dressed as Shanti in a make-up room. Eventually, he decides to leave for US after seeing Shanti in the footage of Om Shanti Om but Om asks him to wait for some days. He eventually performs the story of Shanti's life through a song in front of Mukesh during the music launch of Om Shanti Om. However, Mukesh discovers Sandy's real identity as her body bleeds due to an injury. Mukesh attempts to chase her but is knocked unconscious by a falling chandelier. \n Legal issue After he regains consciousness, Om confronts him over his crime but Mukesh taunts him that he or his \"duplicate Shanti\" cannot convict him for the murder as there is no proof for it. Just then, Sandy reaches the scene. She reveals that after the fire in the set died down, Mukesh returned to the place. Shanti was still alive then, but he buried her alive under the chandelier. She concludes that Shanti's corpse will be found under the chandelier, which will be proof of her murder for the court. Mukesh denies her revelation and attempts to shoot her but Om attacks him and a fire breaks out on the set. He shoots him in his leg and is about to murder him but Sandy stops him, saying that Mukesh is destined to die but not in his hands. She looks at the chandelier which falls and strikes Mukesh dead. \n Plagiarism allegations The next moment, Om is shocked when Pappu and Anwar reach the scene along with \"Sandy\". As he glances back at the one in front of him, he realizes that the one who had revealed the proof of Shanti's murder and killed Mukesh was the real Shanti, a.k.a. the ghost of Shanti. She was responsible for lighting the photograph with fire and knocking Mukesh unconscious too, helping him in his plan. Om reunites with Sandy and waves at Shanti who tearfully smiles at him and disappears, having finally attained peace.\n Reception The film ends with all its cast and crew approaching the set of Om Shanti Om and the credits roll.\n Box office \n Critical response In 2002, Farah Khan worked as a choreographer for the musical Bombay Dreams in London, which she felt presented a \"clich\u00e9d and outdated version\" of the Indian film industry. She thought that the musical would not be successful if released in India. She instead thought of a new story, writing her initial thoughts about the subject on Andrew Lloyd Webber's letterhead while staying in his house. Later in 2006, Farah began to work on her next project, which was tentatively titled Happy New Year. Amid speculations that Shah Rukh Khan would star in Happy New Year, the actor rejected the first draft of the film, upon which Farah's husband and editor Shirish Kunder reminded her of the story she had conceived while in London. Happy New Year, which was to mark Deepika Padukone's Hindi debut, was put on hiatus and revived more than 8 years later under the same title.\n India Farah completed writing the first script of Om Shanti Om within two weeks. She set the first half in the 1970s as she felt the Hindi films made during that period were much more influential than those made in other periods, particularly the 1980s, which she felt was a period when \"the worst movies were made\". She also included many references to the 1970s, which were also prevalent in films of that time. She said, \"Everything in the first half is about the 70s\u2014such as the mother who overacts, mouthing clich\u00e9d dialogues. Then there are cabarets, badminton and other stuff popular during that era.\" Shah Rukh's costumes were designed by Karan Johar, while Manish Malhotra designed Padukone's costumes. The rest of the cast had their costumes designed by Sanjeev Mulchandani.\n International In addition to directing the film, Farah co-wrote the story with Mayur Puri and Mushtaq Shiekh. She was also the film's choreographer. Puri wrote the screenplay and dialogues. He completed the writing process in two months and rewrote the film's second half. Puri created the screenplay by writing his natural reaction to the characters as scenarios. He knew that despite being part of a crowd, junior artists do not want to be recognised as such, ruins their chances of landing a leading role in future. This was used in a sequence involving Shah Rukh and Talpade, who play junior artists. Puri blended different genres together in Om Shanti Om, which he felt was challenging. He used his personal memories from childhood for creating the 1970s. Shirish Kunder was the editor, while V. Manikandan was the cinematographer.\n Accolades Sabu Cyril was the film's production designer. Sabu was first offered the Mani Ratnam-directed Guru  at a time when Om Shanti Om was being planned, but ultimately chosen the latter due to his earlier commitment to Farah for her future project. Farah used two particular dialogues in the film: \"When you want something badly, the whole universe conspires to give to you\" and \"In the end everything will be ok and if its not ok its not the end\". These were used as Khan felt that it reflected her philosophy in her life. Farah stated that the film's opening scene was her most favourite in it. In 2008, Puri felt his most favourite dialogue from the ones he wrote would be the Filmfare Awards speech. The film's title derives from the eponymous song from the film  Karz . Om is a Hindu mantra; Om Shanti Om roughly translates to \"Peace Be With You\".\n Impact The film opens with the grandeur shot of the most famous songs of Karz that is Om Shanti Om featuring Rishi Kapoor and SRK as a junior film artist standing in the crowd.\n Further reading Shah Rukh was cast as the lead; he gained six packs for a song sequence. He felt Om Shanti Om was a \"happy film\".\n Footnotes Farah was advised by Malaika Arora to cast Padukone as the female lead, who was suggested by Wendell Rodricks, under whom Padukone was working. She was cast without a screen test. Khan felt that she was \"a beautiful, classic Indian beauty\" who fit the role of an actor of the 1970s. She was excited at the prospect of working with Shah Rukh and said, \"I've grown up watching  and always admired him so much. To get to work with him\u00a0... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him.\"\n References In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language. Her character was modelled after Malini and nicknamed Dreamy Girl after her the latter's nickname as Dream Girl. Rampal was approached by both Khan and Shah Rukh at the latter's New Year's Eve party. Rampal was initially reluctant to do the role as he felt it was \"too evil\" for someone like him. With persuasion from Shah Rukh, he agreed. Rampal wore a mustache in the film which was suggested by Shah Rukh. Shreyas Talpade played a supporting role as the best friend of Khan's character. After the release of Iqbal  and completing the filming of Dor, Talpade, who attended the same gym as Khan, was called for a narration of what would be Om Shanti Om. He agreed to do the role.\n External links"

    "plot": "\n Plot \n Cast Swades: We, the People  is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language drama film co-written, directed and produced by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Gayatri Joshi and Kishori Ballal while Daya Shankar Pandey, Rajesh Vivek, Lekh Tandon appear in supporting roles.\n Production The plot was based on two episodes of the series Vaapsi on Zee TV's Yule Love Stories  which had Gowariker playing the role of Mohan Bhargav. The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydroelectric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the 2003 Kannada film Chigurida Kanasu which was based on the novel of the same name by Jnanapith awardee K. Shivaram Karanth and Bapu Kuti by Rajni Bakshi. The music and background score was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar. \n Inspiration Swades was theatrically released on 17 December 2004, and it opened to rave reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Khan, Joshi and Ballal, and the story, screenplay, and soundtrack. However, it emerged as a commercial failure at the box office.\n Themes At the 50th Filmfare Awards, Swades received 8 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director  and Best Music Director , and won Best Actor  and Best Background Score .\n Casting and filming It was dubbed in Tamil as Desam and released on 26 January 2005, coinciding with Indian Republic Day. Despite its commercial failure, Swades is regarded ahead of its time and is now considered a cult classic of Hindi cinema and one of the best films in Shah Rukh Khan's filmography. Shahrukh's performance in this film is regarded as among the best performances of his career. The film is owned by Red Chillies Entertainment.\n Reception Mohan Bhargava is a non-resident Indian who works as a Project Manager on the Global Precipitation Measurement  program at NASA in the United States. Mohan came to U. S. for college studies and kept on living there after his parents in India died in a car accident. He keeps worrying about Kaveri Amma, a nanny at his home in Uttar Pradesh who looked after him during his childhood days. After his parents' death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in Delhi and eventually lost contact with Mohan. Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S. Due to the recent success of Phase I of his project, he takes a few weeks off and travels to India. He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a year ago. Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh.\n Critical reception Mohan decides to rent a recreational vehicle to reach the village fearing that he might not get the required facilities there. Upon reaching Charanpur, he meets Kaveri Amma and learns how his childhood friend Geeta  brought Kaveri Amma to stay with her after Mohan's parents died. Geeta runs a school in Charanpur and works hard to improve the living conditions of the villagers through education. However, the village is divided largely by caste and religious beliefs. Geeta does not like Mohan's arrival as she thinks that he will take Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S., leaving her and her younger brother Nandan \"Chiku\" alone. Kaveri Amma tells Mohan that she needs to get Geeta married first and that it is her responsibility. Geeta believes in women empowerment and gender equality. This attracts Mohan towards Geeta and he too tries to help her by campaigning for education among backward communities and also girls. Mohan befriends villagers Nivaaran and Melaram, and they support him in his campaign. Mohan also wins the attention of Dadaji, a kind village chief.\n Box office Slowly love blossoms between Mohan and Geeta. Kaveri Amma asks Mohan to visit a nearby village named Kodi, and collect money from a man named Haridas who owes it to Geeta. Mohan visits Kodi and feels pity seeing Haridas' poor condition, which is such that he is unable to provide his family with meals every day. Haridas tells Mohan that since his caste profession of a weaver wasn't earning him any money, he shifted to tenant farming. But this change in profession led to his ostracization from the village and the villagers even denied him water for his crops. Mohan understands the pathetic situation and realises that many villages in India are still like Kodi. He returns to Charanpur with a heavy heart and decides to do something for the welfare of the village.\n Soundtrack Mohan extends his leave by three more weeks. He learns that electricity inconsistency and frequent power cuts are a big problem in Charanpur. He decides to set up a small hydroelectric power generation facility from a nearby water source. Mohan purchases all the equipment needed from his own funds and oversees the building of the power generation unit. The unit works and the village gets sufficient, consistent power from it.\n Tamil version Dadaji's health deteriorates and he passes away. Mohan is repeatedly called by NASA officials as the GPM project he was working on is reaching important stages and he has to return to the U. S. soon. Kaveri Amma tells him that she prefers to stay in Charanpur as it will be difficult for her to adapt to a new country at her age. Geeta also tells him that she will not settle down in another country and she would prefer it if Mohan stay in India with her and Kaveri Amma. Mohan returns to the U. S. with a heavy heart to complete the project. However, in the U. S., he has flashbacks of his time in India and wishes to return. After the successful completion of his project, he leaves U. S. and returns to India with intentions of working at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, from where he can also work with NASA. The film ends by showing Mohan staying in the village and wrestling with his friend Nivaaran near a temple.\n Awards Swades is inspired by the story of Aravinda Pillalamarri and Ravi Kuchimanchi, the non-resident Indian couple who returned to India and developed a pedal power generator to light remote, off-the-grid village schools. Gowariker spent considerable time with Pillalamarri and Kuchimanchi, both dedicated Association for India's Development  volunteers. He supposedly visited Bilgaon, an Adivasi village in the Narmada valley, which is the backdrop of the Narmada Bachao Andolan  movement. The people of Bilgaon are credited with doing 200 person-days of shramdaan  to make their village energy self-sufficient. The Bilgaon project is recognised as a model for replication by the Government of Maharashtra.\n Legacy The film was reported to be inspired by two episodes of the series titled Vaapsi on Zee TV's Yule Love Stories . The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydro electric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the Kannada novel Chigurida Kanasu by K. Shivaram Karanth and Bapu Kuti by Rajni Bakshi.\n See also Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson, Tushar Gandhi, noted the theme of Gandhism in the film. The name of the main character portrayed by Shah Rukh Khan is Mohan, which was Gandhi's birth name . The film opens with the quotation:\n Notes Hesitating to act because the whole vision might not be achieved, or because others do not yet share it, is an attitude that only hinders progress. External links Gowariker tries to address the lack of scientific temperament and widespread ignorance among the rural folks through the energetic number \"Ye Tara Wo Tara\", where Mohan is seen encouraging the children to experience the fascinating world of stars through his telescope. In a symbolic manner, the song rejects the defunct divisions of caste and class and at the same time, through its protagonist, tries to instill in the audience an appreciation of curiosity and observation.\n Reviews"

The film is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, Red Chillies Entertainment and Azure Entertainment and is a remake of the 2016 Spanish film The Invisible Guest.

Her world turns upside down when she gets arrested for the murder of her secret lover, Arjun. Naina's lawyer, Jimmy Punjabi, hires prestigious defence attorney Badal Gupta to defend her, and over the course of one late evening, they work together to find out what actually happened. Badal reveals that there is a witness whose testimony will incriminate her in the crime. Naina explains that she and Arjun were blackmailed by someone for their extramarital affair. They were called to a hotel where Naina was attacked; only to wake and find Arjun dead with the money meant for the blackmailer. She was arrested but is out on bail. The police find no trace of anyone else being present in the room or breaking in.\n Promotional videos Badal tells Naina that she is not being honest with him and questions her about the disappearance of a young man near the hotel. Naina reveals that she and Arjun went to a cabin in the woods few months ago. On the way back, she accidentally crashed into an oncoming car and killed its driver, a young boy named Sunny. Arjun convinced Naina not to inform the police, and they removed any trace of the crime. They put Sunny's body in the trunk of his car, which Naina dumped in a swamp. While Arjun was waiting for her, Rani and Nirmal, a local couple, met and invited him to their home, where Arjun discovered that they are Sunny's parents. When Rani called Sunny, his phone rang in Arjun's pocket as he had forgotten to dispose of it, making Rani suspicious. Arjun and Naina get away but become worried that they will be discovered soon.\n Dialogue promos Naina watched the news showing that Sunny had embezzled money from the bank where he was working before disappearing. She learned that Arjun had taken Sunny's wallet as they disposed of the body and used his girlfriend's employee credentials to hack into the bank to frame Sunny as a criminal. Rani identifies Naina's car at the scene of her son's disappearance, making her a suspect, but Naina has her lawyer falsify an alibi. The police buy it, but Rani is unconvinced. Rani later confronts Naina at a press event and reveals that she knows the truth. She pleads Naina to tell her Sunny's location but Naina keeps up her act of innocence. A few months later, Arjun and Naina are contacted by the blackmailer, leading to the present events.\n Soundtrack Badal decides that Rani must have killed Arjun and could have easily done so since Sunny's father, Nirmal, works at the hotel.

During production, the film was initially titled Talli and later Ek Tha Talli before being changed to PK as the latter title was found to be too similar to Ek Tha Tiger . The film's soundtrack was composed by Shantanu Moitra, Ajay\u2013Atul and Ankit Tiwari with lyrics written by Swanand Kirkire, Amitabh Varma and Manoj Muntashir. UTV Motion Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures acquired the distribution rights of the film. PK was the first Bollywood film to be shot in Belgium.\n Production PK was released on 19 December 2014.

It currently stands as the 8th highest grossing Indian film of all time. and 9th highest-grossing film in India.\n Development A humanoid alien lands on Earth naked on a research mission in Rajasthan but is stranded when the remote control for his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in Belgium, an Indian woman, Jagat Janani Sahni alias Jaggu, meets a Pakistani, Sarfaraz Yousuf, and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father objects to their relationship, citing difference in their religions. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the wedding due to cultural differences.\n Casting Jaggu returns to India and becomes a news reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's collection box as a refund on God's broken promises. The alien tells her that he is an 'astronaut' from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication; they transfer ideas by holding hands.\n Characters A flashback shows how, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh, who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute Phuljhadiya's hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. The alien begins speaking, and after learning of the whole scenario, Bhairon tells him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behaviour, people assume he is drunk and call him \"peekay\" or \"PK\" ; the alien adopts PK as a name . People tell PK that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. He sincerely practices Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find \"God\", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.\n Title PK conjectures, as Jaggu plays a prank on an unknown caller, that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a \"wrong number\" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen by sending their videos to her news channel. This \"wrong number\" campaign turns into a popular mass movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a \"wrong number\". Bhairon brings the thief to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack.\n Themes Tapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.\n Filming Jaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy receptionist tells her that Sarfaraz has been annoying the embassy officials by repeatedly asking if they received a call from Delhi, implying that he still loves Jaggu. That day, Sarfaraz found the same letter and thought it was from Jaggu, and did not call her as he understood she was under familial pressure. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced by Jaggu's father to return PK's remote.\n Marketing Meanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. He lies to Jaggu that the tapes contain a variety of Earthly noises which he will miss, such as crows and car horns. Jaggu realises his love for her by seeing the note he wrote for her earlier but does not directly confront him about it. PK does not even look back while going as he doesn't want her to see him in tears which will give away his love for her. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him, with Sarfaraz and her family assisting.\n PK: The Game One year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with more members of his species.\n Release \"PK\" was the only film which began with a desire to say something. I can't say what that thing is. The battle was the other way round\u2014how do you say such a serious thing in an entertaining way? For many years, we were struggling, until we finally found a way, where it will be entertaining, won't be offensive\u2014will hit the right notes, basically.\n Distribution \u2014Rajkumar Hirani, director of pk, in an interview to India Insight.\n Soundtrack After the success of 3 Idiots, director Rajkumar Hirani and writer Abhijat Joshi started work for the next project. They had written a story about a character who had the ability to get into another person's mind to make that person a better human being. They spent one year to write a story, but it turned out to be similar to Inception . After watching Inception, Hirani and Joshi were shocked by the similarities. Eventually, they decided to scrap the film, then Hirani and Joshi reworked on the script, changing the entire tone and angle. It took five years to make the film and three years to write it.\n Track listing In PK, Khan played nine avatars and, during the course of the film, the actor had to chew over 10,000 betelnut preparations called paan.\u200a Betelnut is a psychoactive stimulant used throughout Asia and characterized by its ability to stain users' mouths red. \"In real life paan is not a habit, I have it once in a while but for this film I chew paan for every scene. I would at times eat about 100 paans in a day. We had a paanwala  on the sets,\" said Khan in the report. For every take, Khan had to eat a fresh paan to fill his mouth. Before beginning the shoot, he would eat at least 10\u201315 paans to get the right color inside his mouth and on his lips.\n Reception Viral Thakkar was the visual effects supervisor. The visual effects company was Riva Digital at a point employing 100 artists working on the film.\n Box office In 2011, Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma signed on for the film. Khan's nephew Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were considered for a role which eventually went to Sushant Singh Rajput before the release of his debut movie Kai Po Che . Earlier reports said that Rajkumar Hirani had signed Arshad Warsi for the film when it was reported that Arshad will be playing an important role. In 2013, Warsi said in an interview \"I couldn't have worked out on dates. I wouldn't refuse Raju for anything. In fact, when he offered me the film, I did not even ask for the script, I was like I am ready to come on whenever you want. So that is the connection I share with Raju.\" Before Rajput and Warsi were signed on, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were said to be cast in the film. Junaid Khan, son of Aamir Khan worked as an assistant director in this film.\n Domestic In 2011, in its initial scripting stage, Hirani named the film Talli, then changed it to Ek Tha Talli which he loved, but later on came to know that Ek Tha Tiger was already in production . He dropped the idea and, after many titles, he came up with a title that only had initials, PK. After starting the film, Hirani felt PK was not a good enough title. He decided to change the title to Talli. But after a few weeks of shooting, Hirani decided to go back to the original title.\n International Firstpost compared PK to Hirani and Khan's previous collaboration 3 Idiots, as they both involve \"A socially awkward and 'different' young man\u2014who walks and talks in a strange, enthusiastic childlike manner\u2014observes the system, questions it, asks you to look at the many ludicrous things that inform it, and eventually brings about a minor revolution.\"\n East Asia According to Hirani, PK is a \"satire on Hindu gods and their godmen\". The co-director Khan began looking for shooting locations in July 2012. Second unit filming was set to begin in late 2012, which was stalled after the rumoured departure of three department heads for the film and bad weather stalling initial shoots. Hirani denied rumours that the film would be delayed, stating that principal filming had always been intended to begin in mid-January 2013 in Delhi and Rajasthan to \"capture the winter of Delhi\".\n Records Shooting officially began on 1 February 2013, with the filming scheduled to occur over a 45-day period.

A 26-day schedule of shooting of PK started in Delhi from 27 September 2013.\n Awards and nominations The film was marketed by a Mumbai Based company named Spice PR owned by Prabhat Choudhary.\n Sequel The makers released a teaser trailer on 23 October 2014. It achieved 3.4\u00a0million views on YouTube within five days, subsequently receiving 12 million views. It was regarded as the most viewed movie trailers on YouTube. The teaser was attached with the film Happy New Year .\n Controversies In August, the makers found a new promotional strategy to interact with the audiences by introducing talking standees. This was the first time a Bollywood film used a talking standee at varied locations as a part of its promotions. The standee had Khan talking to people in a prominent places in popular theatres and multiplexes.\n See also On 7 December 2014, Khan began the city tour for promotions with Patna. The character he plays speaks in Bhojpuri which is the main language used for communication in Bihar. Aamir said at the event \"I have decided to launch the promotional campaign of my film PK from Bihar to connect with the language. My character speaks Bhojpuri in the film.\" Hence, the actor decided to start his promotional schedule from Bihar. Although he wanted to visit Bhojpur, which is 60 kilometers from Bihar, he could not because of security issues. In Bihar he visited a litti chokha stall. The visit resulted in a surge of customers to the shop, and the shop owner put up pictures of Khan eating the local delicacy. Then the crew proceeded to Varanasi where they had a screening of their film 3 Idiots and interacted with the people. Khan made an impromptu visit to Krishana Paan shop to savor a Banarasi pan. The actor specially removed time from his schedule to visit this place. He enjoyed a \"mitha banarasi paan\" there. After the crew visited Delhi, Ahemdabad, Raipur, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Indore, Bangalore and other locations in India.

    "plot": "\n Plot Lakshya  is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age war-drama film directed by Farhan Akhtar and produced by Ritesh Sidhwani. It stars Amitabh Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta in lead roles with Boman Irani and Anjula Bedi in supporting roles. Based on the 1999 Kargil War, the film is about Karan Sheirgill, an aimless and lazy boy from Delhi who joins the Indian Army and transforms himself into a soldier to make his girlfriend Romila Dutta proud of him.\n Cast At the 50th Filmfare Awards, Lakshya received 4 nominations, including Best Director  and Best Actor , and won 2 awards \u2013 Best Choreography  and Best Cinematography. Although not a block buster at the box office. The film has gained a cult following.\n Production Karan Sheirgill is an aimless and lazy boy living in Delhi who has no goals for his future. His father Sanjeev Sheirgill is a wealthy businessman and his mother Shalini Sheirgill is a housewife. His girlfriend Romila Dutta aka Romi, an aspiring journalist, tries to make him understand that he needs to have a goal in life. Karan also wonders why he does not know what he wishes to pursue in life. Eventually, he thinks of joining the Indian Army after his one of his friends decides to do so. However, his father ends up lashing out at him on learning about his decision. Infuriated, he decides to stick to his decision. Karan gives the Combined Defence Services Examination and gets selected into the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun. However, he is undisciplined and unused to life over there. He keeps receiving punishments during the military training from the team due to his overconfidence and laziness. Upset, he flees from the academy and is forced to confront his parents' low opinion of him. His decision also causes Romi to angrily break up with him for not respecting his own decision. Devastated, Karan finally comes to terms with his situation and returns to the Indian Military Academy, takes his punishment, and becomes a focused, disciplined officer cadet.\n Soundtrack 1 year later, he commissions into the Indian Army as a lieutenant and is congratulated by his mother. Karan is posted to the 3rd battalion of the Punjab Regiment, commanded by Colonel Sunil Damle. The battalion is stationed in Kargil, Ladakh. Karan returns to Delhi on leave and is heartbroken to learn that Romi is getting engaged to her colleague Rajeev Goel. He meets his parents as well but his leave is cut short and he is recalled to his battalion due to an outbreak of hostilities in Kargil. He reports back to his battalion, where he is promoted to the rank of acting Captain. Colonel Damle briefs the officers on the latest situation and reveals that a number of infiltrators have crossed the Line of Control  from Pakistan and currently occupy a series of mountain peaks on the Indian side of the border. The battalion has been assigned to secure Point 5179, a crucial vantage point dominating the army's main supply line, the National Highway 1D. The northern side of the mountain is on the Pakistani side of the LoC, the western side has a 1000-foot vertical rock cliff and the southern side has 3\u00a0km of empty ground with no cover. Therefore, the battalion decides to attack from the eastern side of the mountain. The first part of the assault is successful. The battalion destroys the enemy's screening units with Karan cited for his bravery in saving another officer's life. Meanwhile, Romi gets stationed to Kargil as a war correspondent. Romi goes to Kargil where she meets a changed Karan and begins to fall in love with him again amidst the war. However, Karan remains reluctant to return her feelings as he is still under the impression that she's engaged. In the second phase of the assault, the battalion attacks the peak of the mountain but fails to capture it due to the strategic advantage and heavy weaponry the Pakistanis have. The unit suffers heavy casualties. Brigadier Puri summons Colonel Damle and gives him 48 hours to capture the peak \u2013 after that time period, responsibility for Point 5179 will be given to another battalion. Colonel Damle then orders a group of 12 officers and soldiers  to scale the 1000-foot rock cliff on the western side of the mountain and flank the enemy stronghold. They will be provided with artillery support from the eastern side. Karan realises that he has finally found his goal in the form of capturing the peak. Karan also learns of Romi's failed engagement and expresses his feelings for her. Romi promises Karan she will wait for him whether he returns or not. The unit sets off on their mission and while moving through a grass field toward the rock cliff, they come under fire. The unit discovers a Pakistani mortar unit in the field and destroys it, but loses their commanding officer and a number of other soldiers. The team's radios are also destroyed, so they cannot communicate with battalion HQ. Out of the initial 12, only 6 remain. They decide to continue with the mission. They successfully scale the cliff and attack the Pakistani position during the night. Their assault is successful although Karan is wounded, and the team loses 3 more men. The next morning, Karan limps to the peak, where he plants the Indian flag and fires a flare, signalling to Colonel Damle and Subedar Major Pritam Singh that they captured the peak. Days later, Karan is shown leaving a military hospital and reuniting with his parents and Romi who asks him that what is his next aim after attaining his first one. Karan replies \"you\" and they both embrace.\n Track list The film ends with Colonel Damle paying respect to all the martyrs of Operation Vijay.\n Box office Production of the film began in Mumbai, Maharashtra and it was shot at several different locations in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The scenes in Kargil were shot in Ladakh. Some parts of the film centered around Hrithik Roshan's military training were also shot at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun. Actual Indian Army officers also participated in the shooting of the film. Seeing both the actors and officers in the same getup, at times Preity Zinta would get confused separating the actual officers from the actors. Pankaj Tripathi, then a struggling actor, shot for the film at Ladakh with Roshan and this news went viral in Tripathi's village that he is shooting a film with a big actor like Roshan. But Tripathi's role was all cut during the editing and he was very disappointed to see that his role was cut from the film.\n Critical reception The film's soundtrack was composed by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Shaan's \"Main Aisa Kyun Hoon\", picturized on Hrithik, is a laid-back, funky-hip hop track. \"Agar Main Kahoon\" is the love duet, picturized on Hrithik-Preity. The trio used harmonica for the track. The title track \"Lakshya\" is a techno-flavored patriotic song by Shankar Mahadevan, which is followed by \"Kandhon Se Milte\", another patriotic song with the vocals of Kunal Ganjawala and Vijay Prakash. \"Kitni Baatein\", a pathos song, is crooned by Hariharan and Sadhana Sargam. There are two instrumentals, \"Victory\" and \"Separation\". The trumpet portion from \"Victory\" has been used as the background music for their logo by Excel.\n Awards The soundtrack received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama in his review, said \"Lakshya does have good music that is very urban and will appeal to the class audience. Going by the theme of the movie, the album is pretty balanced and has been composed with style that speaks of class.\" Planet Bollywood found the album to be \"as good as Dil Chahta Hai\". Subhash K. Jha described the album as \"daringly unusual sound with a show-offy kind of innovativeness\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com, however, remarked that, though the album was good, it was below expectations and \"lacked punch\". According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 11,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's thirteenth highest-selling.\n References Lakshya netted around Rs. 23\u00a0crore at the domestic box office. Lakshya grossed $5,859,242 worldwide including $753,600 from North American markets and $5,105,642 from other markets. In the U.S., it performed better, grossing $380,000 on 59 screens  in its opening weekend with the per screen average being around $6,440.\n External links"

    "plot": "\n Plot A Wednesday! is a 2008 Indian Hindi-language thriller film written and directed by Neeraj Pandey and produced by Ronnie Screwvala, Anjum Rizvi and Shital Bhatia under UTV Motion Pictures and Friday Filmworks. The film stars Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher, and set between 2\u00a0pm and 6\u00a0pm on a Wednesday, the film depicts a confrontation between a police commissioner and an anonymous caller who threatens to detonate bombs throughout Mumbai if four terrorists are not freed from police custody.\n Cast The film was released on 5 September 2008 and emerged as a commercial success. It was also granted tax exemption in the state of Maharashtra. Subsequently, it won a number of awards including the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director at the 56th National Film Awards. It went on to be remade in Tamil and Telugu simultaneously as Unnaipol Oruvan and Eenadu , and as an English-language Sri Lankan film A Common Man .\n Soundtrack Mumbai police commissioner Prakash Rathod describes in a voice-over that he is going to retire the following day. He goes on to describe the most challenging case he faced in his career.\n Production An unnamed man carries a travel bag, assumed to contain explosives, in the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station and proceeds to hide the bag in the restroom of a police station opposite the Mumbai Police headquarters. He then goes to the rooftop of a building under construction where he set up his base of operations, equipped with sim cards, mobile phones, and other gadgets. He calls Rathod and informs him that he has placed five bombs in locations throughout Mumbai and has programmed them to explode simultaneously within four hours unless the Commissioner gives in to his demands and releases four terrorists. Rathod alerts his team to trace the location of the caller. The caller tips off television news reporter Naina Roy, telling her it is going to be \"the most important day of her life\".\n Release The four terrorists demanded by the caller are rounded up by police officers Arif and Jai. Police depute a young hacker named Anuj to track the location of the caller. The caller asks the two police officers to leave the four militants near a bench on a Juhu Aviation Base runway, but Arif leaves only three behind and takes one of them, Ibrahim Khan, captive as he suspects that the caller would not reveal the locations of the bombs even after the militants are released.\n Reception A phone placed under the bench rings and an explosion occurs, killing the three terrorists. The anonymous caller reveals he does not belong to any terrorist organization, and his plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them. The caller, being just a \"stupid common man wanting to clean his house\", sought to avenge the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in major cities in India, specifically the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. His final demand is that the officers kill Ibrahim themselves or he will set off all five bombs in Mumbai. Rathod indirectly orders Arif and Jai to kill Ibrahim and make it look like it was done in self-defense.\n Box office After the death of Ibrahim is confirmed on the news, the caller calls Rathod for a final time to reveal that he has not planted any other bombs in the city. Rathod declares he already knew there were no more bombs hence his decision to kill the last terrorist was not taken in fear but in confidence. Rathod reaches the caller's location just as the caller is leaving, having destroyed all his equipment. The two meet briefly when Rathod, identifying the caller on the basis of a face sketch, offers the man a ride home.\n Awards and nominations In a voiceover, Rathod says the man told him his real name, but he does not wish to reveal it since doing so would give away the man's religion. Rathod admits that he knew the caller was disturbed because of the incompetence of the governing authorities, but he never imagined a common man would go to such lengths to achieve this end. He also notes that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it, and further acknowledges that although the incident has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best.\n Remakes Music composition by Sanjoy Chowdhury with lyrics inscribed by Irshad Kamil & Bulleh Shah. The soundtrack album is released under T-Series label. 6 Songs In Album, But No-one Features In Movie.\n References From casting to completion, A Wednesday! took about eight months. It was filmed on location around Mumbai in 28 days. The terrorist's 'workstation' was an actual under-construction 25-storey building; it was chosen from 50 other such buildings for its clear view of the Mumbai skyline. Since the building had no elevators, a trolley lift was installed; Shah walked up the 25 floors every day. Shah mentioned in an interview that it was the first film of his career where he did not change a single word. He was first offered Kher's role.\n External links"
